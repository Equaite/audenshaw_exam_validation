### Spelling and Punctuation
- **Spelling**: The student has generally spelled words correctly. There are a few minor errors such as ""goverment"" instead of ""government"" and ""Britains'"" instead of ""Britain's"".
- **Punctuation**: The punctuation is mostly accurate, but there are some issues. For example, the sentence ""Britain and France both promised to attack if Germany tried to invade Belgium and try to keep them out."" could be clearer with better punctuation. Additionally, the use of commas and periods could be improved for better readability.

### Grammar
- **Grammar Control**: The student demonstrates a good grasp of grammar, but there are some areas where the control of meaning could be improved. For example, the phrase ""built made tensions high in Europe"" is awkward and should be corrected to ""built up tensions in Europe."" Another example is ""this also built tension as many people thought it was the German goverment behind it,"" which could be clearer.
- **Overall Meaning**: Despite some grammatical errors, the overall meaning of the response is clear and understandable. The student effectively communicates their argument and supports it with relevant points.

### Use of Specialist Terms
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Triple Entente,"" ""assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" and ""allies."" These terms are relevant to the topic and demonstrate a good understanding of the subject matter.

### Level Assessment
- **Level 1 Criteria**: The student does not meet the criteria for Level 1 as there are some spelling and punctuation errors, and the control of grammar is not consistently accurate.
- **Level 2 Criteria**: The student meets most of the criteria for Level 2. They spell and punctuate with considerable accuracy, use rules of grammar with general control of meaning, and employ a good range of specialist terms.
- **Level 3 Criteria**: The student exceeds the criteria for Level 3 as their spelling and punctuation are more accurate than ""reasonable,"" and their use of specialist terms is more extensive than ""limited.""

### Final Analysis
Given the student's performance, they fall into Level 2. They demonstrate considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of grammar, and a good range of specialist terms. While there are some errors, they do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.

We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But

racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.

The allies use the cover created by the smoke and explosions to advance through no-mans land with the element of surprise. This allowed it so that the enemy would have a difficult time discerning where the enemy were attacking from. This form of tactical manouvering is known as a 'creeping barrage'. The allies would time artillery bombardment at certain angles and simultaneously the soldiers would 'creep in'.

Tanks were first introduced in the battle of the Somme 1916, but were largely inneffective as they were slow (only reaching speeds of 4 mph), many tactics were

not developed for them as the British thought of not much use for them. But by 1917 and 1918, tanks were being deployed in large rows of 200-300 tanks which would cross over no-mans land and destroy the barbed wire defences.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was heavily reliant on Russia taking a long time to mobilize and a very quick and decisive win against France (in 40 days). The plan was to have a large bulk of the German army invade France by cutting into Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to surprise the French, who would be anticipating an attack directly into France on the boarder between them. However, the Schlieffen plan failed as Russia only took 10 days to mobilize (faster than expected) and Belgium put up a fierce and resistance fight against the Germans (much more resistance than Germany had anticipated). Ultimately, invading through Belgium only helped the stalemate last longer as Britain was forced to join the war effort as invading Belgium initiated an 1843 treaty of London where Britain vowed to protect Belgium. This prolonged the war significantly, turning 40 days into 4 years.

    - N/A",,"I agree with the statement as the alliances meant that Europe was divided in two different camps. The alliances were the main trigger for many of the events, wars and crises that led up to world war one. The black hand (a terrorist group) assasinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the heir to the austrian-hungarian throne) leaving only serbia to blame for the assasination. Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany. Then Germany invaded Belgium bringing Britain into the war as it triggered the 1843 treaty of London which Britain vowed to protect Belgium from invading forces. Because of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's death,Europe was involved in an all-out war.

In 1871, shortly after Germany's unification, Germany and Austria-Hungary made an alliance together as they both shared similar cuteral identities,had shared the same common language of German and were politically close to each other. Later, the Italians joined the dual alliance to form the triple alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. In 1892, France and Russia formed an alliance together. This was a threat towards Germany as it meant they could be attacked from either the East or the West. Later in 1904, Britain formed an alliance with France, known as the Entente Cordiale (Friendly alliance). Then in 1906, Britain, France and Russia all came together to form the triple Entente. The alliance system made political disputes more intense as one disagreement could lead to a major war. This is clearly seen in the Moroccan crisises and the Balkan wars. The involvement of this many countries made it impossible to avoid an all  out war from breaking out in Europe, thus causing the start of World War One.",6,16,,,,,1721054094.7404711,"**Step-by-Step Grading Explanation:**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors such as ""assasinated"" (should be ""assassinated""), ""austrian-hungarian"" (should be ""Austro-Hungarian""), ""cuteral"" (should be ""cultural""), and ""crisises"" (should be ""crises"").
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some missing commas and periods that could improve readability. For example, ""Europe was divided in two different camps"" could use a comma after ""camps."" Additionally, ""austrian-hungarian throne"" should be capitalized as ""Austro-Hungarian throne.""
   - Despite these errors, the overall meaning is not significantly hindered.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall. There are some awkward phrasings and run-on sentences, but they do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.
   - For example, ""Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force)"" could be clearer with better punctuation and structure.
   - The use of parentheses is appropriate but could be better integrated into the sentences.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""alliances,"" ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Austro-Hungarian throne,"" ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""triple Entente,"" ""Moroccan crises,"" and ""Balkan wars.""
   - These terms are used appropriately and demonstrate a good understanding of the historical context.

**Conclusion:**
- The student demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, though not consistent accuracy.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning, though there are some areas that could be improved for clarity.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student’s answer fits well within **Level 2**. The errors present do not significantly hinder the overall meaning, and the use of specialist terms is strong. Therefore, the answer is awarded **3 marks**.","{'burn_in_runs': 2, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 1826, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.00913, 'completion_tokens': 1111, 'completion_cost': 0.016665, 'total_cost': 0.025795}",3,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 2078, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.01039, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.010405}",True,1721054157.259941,32.701486110687256,0.036199999999999996

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B it shows the British Soilders advancing under an artillery barrage. The british Soilder were running in waves all in different waves. this is because they cannot be in any artillery barage. you can see that all the soilders are running and still alive and not getting under an artillery barage. Each wave protects you from a plane and from bombs dropping on you.

In Source C it Shows that the german Soilder were preparing an attack on the british tank, but then 7 of the newest and fastest tanks named whippets came and drove straight into the german Soilders and scattered them in all directions, which this had destroyed the German threat. This helps the students studying military technology understand about how fast and powerful the Whippet was.

### Hypothetical Example Answer and Grading:

**Hypothetical Answer:**
""The Schlieffen Plan was Germany's strategy to quickly defeat France by advancing through Belgium and then turning to fight Russia. However, the plan led to several problems in 1914. Firstly, the German advance was slowed down by the unexpected resistance from Belgian and British troops. This delay allowed the French to regroup and counterattack at the Battle of the Marne, leading to a stalemate. Additionally, the Germans had to divert troops to the Eastern Front because Russia mobilized faster than expected. This weakened their forces in the west. As a result, both sides dug trenches, leading to a prolonged and static war on the Western Front.""

**Grading:**

1. **Annotate the Answer:**
   - ""The Schlieffen Plan was Germany's strategy to quickly defeat France by advancing through Belgium and then turning to fight Russia."" (Basic understanding, Level 1)
   - ""The German advance was slowed down by the unexpected resistance from Belgian and British troops."" (Simple analysis, Level 2)
   - ""This delay allowed the French to regroup and counterattack at the Battle of the Marne, leading to a stalemate."" (Developed analysis, Level 3)
   - ""The Germans had to divert troops to the Eastern Front because Russia mobilized faster than expected."" (Developed analysis, Level 3)
   - ""As a result, both sides dug trenches, leading to a prolonged and static war on the Western Front."" (Developed analysis, Level 3)

2. **Determine a Level:**
   - The answer clearly surpasses Level 1 and Level 2.
   - The answer fits well within Level 3 as it provides developed analysis and a range of accurate knowledge and understanding.
   - The answer does not fully reach Level 4 as it lacks complex sequencing and reasoning, and does not show how tension increased at different stages or the full consequences of the events.

3. **Determine a Mark:**
   - Comparing to exemplar answers, this answer is solidly within Level 3 but does not exhibit the depth and complexity required for Level 4.
   - Therefore, I would award it 6 marks, which is the maximum for Level 3.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - **Spelling:**
     - ""Morrocan"" should be ""Moroccan.""
     - ""Morroco"" should be ""Morocco.""
     - ""britian"" should be ""Britain.""
     - ""rebillion"" should be ""rebellion.""
     - ""tukey"" should be ""Turkey.""
   - **Punctuation:**
     - The sentence ""This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence."" is a run-on sentence and needs better punctuation.
     - ""This was to see how far France would push. And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support."" could be better punctuated for clarity.
     - ""Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state."" needs better punctuation and capitalization.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The sentence structure is often awkward and lacks clarity.
   - ""This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence."" is grammatically incorrect and confusing.
   - ""And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support."" should be rephrased for better grammatical accuracy.
   - ""Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state."" is grammatically incorrect and unclear.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses some specialist terms such as ""Moroccan crisis,"" ""kaiser,"" and ""allies.""
   - However, the range of specialist terms is limited and not used effectively.

### Level Determination:

- **Level 1 Criteria:**
  - The student does not spell and punctuate with consistent accuracy.
  - The student does not use rules of grammar with effective control of meaning overall.
  - The student does not use a wide range of specialist terms as appropriate.

- **Level 2 Criteria:**
  - The student does not spell and punctuate with considerable accuracy.
  - The student does not use rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall.
  - The student does not use a good range of specialist terms as appropriate.

- **Level 3 Criteria:**
  - The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, though there are several errors.
  - The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, and the errors do not significantly hinder meaning overall.
  - The student uses a limited range of specialist terms as appropriate.

Given the analysis, the student's answer fits best within **Level 3**. The errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar are present but do not severely hinder the overall meaning. The use of specialist terms is limited but present.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows a depiction of the Western Front with two types of new technology and tactics being shown. The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. 

Source C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C 
describes how the army constantly made new prototypes 
as the tanks so they could be faster and cause 
more casualties. This meant there was less hand to 
hand fighting because of the tanks physiological and 
devastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C 
is useful to a historian because it has personal 
story from someone actually experiencing the power 
of tanks, showing how the threat they brought. ",9,12,,,,,1721054348.2776608,"**Step-by-Step Explanation of Grading:**

He wanted to prove Germany's strength and it was clear he would not back down a third time, therefor
