The statement \"You deal and finance with the problems directly\" is vague and does not align with the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n\n- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**\n  - Since the candidate did not identify a clear advantage, there is no explanation provided. The statement \"You deal and finance with the problems directly\" does not explain any specific advantage of a private limited company. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n\n### Example Answers Comparison:\n- The example answers provide clear advantages such as \"The owners would have limited liability\" and \"The business can sell shares to raise finance,\" followed by detailed explanations. The candidate's response does not provide a comparable level of clarity or detail.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The candidate's response does not meet any of the marking criteria.

Let's evaluate the response against the marking criteria:\n\n- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:\n  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, \"A smaller business means a lower reputation so that means they'll attract less foot traffic in person.\" This suggests that the business might not rely on physical location due to lower foot traffic. This identification is somewhat implicit but can be credited as it aligns with the idea of using the internet to mitigate the need for a physical presence.\n  - **Mark: 1**\n\n- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:\n  - The candidate explains the way by stating, \"but can possibly use a website to promote because a lot of advertisement is done digitally.\" This explanation indicates that the business can use the internet for digital promotion, which can affect its location choice.\n  - However, the explanation lacks depth. It does not fully develop the idea of how using a website for promotion can influence the business's location choice, such as choosing a cheaper location or not requiring a physical retail location.\n  - **Mark: 1**\n\nThe candidate's response has identified a way and provided a basic explanation, but it lacks the depth and development needed for full marks.

Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany. Then Germany invaded Belgium bringing Britain into the war as it triggered the 1843 treaty of London which Britain vowed to protect Belgium from invading forces.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "I think option 1 is more suitable by reducing the tax paid by a small business.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "In order to help small business, the government should consider to reduce the tax paid by small businesses. This would lead to small businesses giving less tax and use the money to cover total cost, staffs, wages/salary, or use the money to improve the products or services they aid.

As a result of this, the business may fail.\n\nAnother reason is that the money the small businesses have left over, they could use that money to help charities or people in need.

On the other hand Source C is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the first World War because, the Source is talking about tanks and their new versions, this is useful as it is showing how the British went from tanks that were sent out in ones which led to them being easily picked out and broken by tanks being upgraded and being sent out in groups of 7's, 10, 20's etc, due to the tanks being sent out in groups this led to mass destruction and caused the German soldiers to be scared, it also nullified things such as barbed wire as the tanks could just go over them and flatten them causing the soldiers to be able to easily pass through without being cut, the tanks also provided cover, due to their size and speed multiple soldiers could follow from behind, and the tanks were also upgraded from just having a big cannon that took a long time to turn to having machine guns at the top that could turn a whole 360\u00b0, this is useful as it shows the evolution in weapons.", "awarded_marks": 9, "total_marks": 12.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": "{0: [0], 4: [10, 12], 3: [9, 7], 2: [4, 6], 1: [1, 3]}", "start_time": 1724444647.0150359, "llm_graded_answer": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and provides a detailed analysis of their content. For Source B, the student explains the tactic of artillery barrage and how it was used to create a barrier for soldiers, pushing back the enemy until the trench was reached. The student also evaluates the provenance by noting that the source was published by a British newspaper, which might present the tactic as flawless. This shows an understanding of potential bias, which is a key aspect of evaluating the usefulness of a source.\n\nFor Source C, the student describes the evolution of tank technology and tactics, explaining how newer tanks like the 'Whippets' were faster, more numerous, and equipped with machine guns, which made them more effective in battle. The student also notes the impact of these tanks on the battlefield, such as their ability to flatten barbed wire and provide cover for soldiers. This detailed analysis of the content, combined with the understanding of the source's provenance (a first-hand account by a tank commander), makes the evaluation comprehensive.\n\nHowever, the student could improve by explicitly linking the content and provenance to the utility for historians more consistently. For example, they could state more clearly how the first-hand account in Source C provides a reliable perspective on the effectiveness of tanks, or how the British newspaper's portrayal in Source B might influence public perception of military tactics.\n\nOverall, the answer demonstrates developed evaluation of both sources based on content and provenance, with extended reasoning related to utility. Therefore, this answer falls into Level 3 and should be awarded 9 marks.

If there is insufficient wind, the wind farm will not generate energy, which directly impacts the investors who rely on this energy supply.\n   - The risk is clearly articulated and directly related to the context of Ripple's business model, which depends on wind energy to supply its customers.\n\n### Evidence from the Context:\n- The context mentions that Ripple is a wind farm providing green energy. The dependency on wind is implicit in the nature of a wind farm.\n- The answer aligns with the context as it highlights a potential operational risk (lack of wind) that could affect energy production and, consequently, the return on investment for the investors.\n\n### Comparison with Example Answers:\n- The example answers provided in the mark scheme include risks such as \"Loss of money invested in the wind farm\" and \"Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy.\"\n- The given answer is similar in nature as it identifies a specific operational risk that could lead to a failure in energy production, which is a valid concern for investors.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, specifically the risk associated with the variability of wind, which is essential for energy production in a wind farm.\n- This risk is directly relevant to the context of Ripple's business model and fits within the scope of the marking criteria.\n\n### Marks Awarded:\n- **1 mark** (out of 1 possible mark)\n\nThe answer meets the criteria set out in the mark scheme and provides a clear and relevant risk for investors in Ripple.", "llm_graded_answer_token_costing": {"burn_in_runs": 1, "model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 662, "prompt_token_cost": 0.00331, "completion_tokens": 405, "completion_cost": 0.006075, "total_cost": 0.009385}, "llm_awarded_marks": 1, "llm_awarded_marks_token_costing": {"burn_in_runs": 1, "model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 443, "prompt_token_cost": 0.002215, "completion_tokens": 1, "completion_cost": 1.5e-05, "total_cost": 0.0022299999999999998}, "end_time": 1724444830.814528, "elapsed_time_in_seconds": 4.564198970794678}, {"subject_id": "edexcel_business_studies", "question_id": 7.2, "question_type": "bs_identify", "student_id": 5025, "question_text": "Using the information in Table 4, identify which type of energy use declined the most between 2018 and 2019.", "mark_scheme_text": "marking_criteria:\n  -

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "The price at Ripple is better than its competitors which allows it to be more cost effective for people who sign up for Ripple and they are also helping the environment as well as Ripple is an eco-friendly company which creates zero emissions.

This tactic worked majority of the times, but had one big problem. The shells were going so close that if they were fired wrong then they would kill their own soldiers.\n\nSource C is useful to a historian because it talks about the development of tanks. At first tanks were slow which made them an easy target for the germans. The british used the tanks in large groups followed by soldiers. The tanks would provide cover for soldiers and they could destroy barbed wire so the troops could get through later on tanks were improved they were faster and better weapons on board for example bigger shells and turrets.

Due to a Serbian group called 'Black Hand' the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Franz Ferdinand) was assainated in Sarajevo. This caused massive tension between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia however Serbia was close allies with Russia and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia. Austria-Hungary asked Germany if they would back them up and Germany agreed to do so. This caused tension between Germany and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Moroccan Crisis had a big effect on why the first word war began. France wanted Control of Morocco and with Britain and France being allies, Britain encouraged France to do so. The German Kaiser wanted an Empire and so taking Morocco would be a good start. He believed Germany should have Morocco and he even visited it. A Conference took place in Algiers to decide who should have Morocco. Most Countries agreed France should take control and Germany was humiliated. The Kaiser was furious and tensions were rising between France and Germany.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "The place of where there windmills are important as it is located in a remote area of South Wales. This means the customers can receive energy elsewhere and not be disturbed by the large windmills. This opportunity seems desirable as the members won't be disturbed and they feel that they are improving the environment.\r\n\r\nThe method of the customers being promoted to members of the business is very simple. This makes it more convenient for the people which is also a customer's need. Making promotion more convenient for customers allows Ripple to add value to their service meaning they can increase profit which leads to further future success in the business.\r\n\r\nThis is very important as \r\n\r\nThe way Ripple produces their energy is through renewable energy. As it mentions, it doesn't harm the environment but keeps it a healthier place. This is important because it stands out as their USP. Having a USP makes their business stand out amongst the market, which will attract customers. They can increase members paying for their service which leads to an increase in revenue. This increase in revenue is important as they can use the extra money on further development for the business.\r\n\r\nRipple is flexible with the way the price of their energy plans are set at. The amount of money customers can invest varies on their energy needs. This Is beneficial to the customers as they won't need to pay a fixed price where they could be wasting money. Also, Ripple claims their services are cheaper than other competitors. This will attract customers because customers aim to find the best value for their money. Ripple's pricing is crucial as it gives the customers a choice. This will lead to an increase in members because of the vast options they offer.\r\nTo conclude, Ripple's marketing mix helps form the type of business that they are. It will definitely help them in the survival of their business\r\n", "awarded_marks": 3, "total_marks": 12.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": "{0: [0], 1: [1, 4], 2: [8, 5], 3: [9, 12]}", "start_time": 1724445262.9362078, "llm_graded_answer": "The candidate's response covers several aspects of Ripple's marketing mix, but it lacks focus on the importance of price specifically.

Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy.

For example, Source B shows a new tactic developed in the war called a creeping barrage this is when artillery from very far behind shoot in front of their own men and the explosions give cover and make it easy for them to advance toward enemy trenches. Australia were very known for using this tactic and were very good at it, they would get really close to the artillery fire and advance very quickly. Source C is also useful to a historian as it is written by a tank commander which means it very reliable, another reason why source C is helpful is it showcases a newly developed weapon and illustrates how significant it was in the first world war. The source tells a short story on Frank Mitchell and how he was stuck bound to be attacked when seven of their newest, fastest tanks raced past called 'wippets'. The source also says about the tanks machine guns which had also been worked on alot during the first world war, the original machine gun the 'vickers gun' was very heavy so was mostly used stationary with a crew of six men operating it the new machine gun the lewis gun was much lighter and very easy to be operated by 1-2 men and was the first development of the assault rifle.

For Source B, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and its effectiveness, mentioning Australia's proficiency with this tactic. This shows a clear understanding of the military tactics used during the First World War. For Source C, the student highlights the reliability of the source due to its author being a tank commander and provides a detailed account of the new tank technology, specifically the 'Whippets' and their impact on the battlefield. The student also discusses the development of machine guns, comparing the Vickers gun and the Lewis gun, which adds depth to the analysis.\n\nHowever, the evaluation of the provenance of Source B is missing, and the evaluation of Source C's provenance could be more developed. The student does not explicitly link the content and provenance to the utility of the sources for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of both sources, including a discussion of their provenance and how it affects their utility. Additionally, the student should evaluate the relationship between the sources and how they together provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nOverall, the answer falls into Level 3 due to the developed evaluation of the content of both sources and the extended reasoning related to utility.

In the late 19th century France and Russia as well as Austria-Hungary and Germany allied to protect themselves from each other in case of a war.

If there is no wind, the investors may not receive the energy they need, which is a valid risk for an investor in a wind farm. This aligns with the example answer \"Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs (1)\" from the mark scheme.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple by highlighting the dependency on wind for energy production.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "The importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix is significant as it helps them to compete. This is because they question customers to find out how much energy they use. This helps Ripple create a price for the customer to invest and helps to reduce how much the customers pay. This helps to match and offer lower prices to competitors. This may attract customers as price is a customer need. Another reason why price is important is that it helps to determine how much energy a customer gets. This is important as it will increase the reliability and quality of their service and product as it lets them know that they are getting value for their money. This may keep customers more loyal and increase Ripple's sales. However, price may not be as important in Ripple's marketing mix. Place is also an important part. This is because Ripple needs to locate its turbines to the areas with the most wind. This will help increase the productivity of the turbines which will help improve the efficiency. This will give the customers a lower price which may attract them even more. Where they are located is also important as it may require them to pay more to transport energy to customers, raising their prices. This may prevent customers from using Ripple as they may not get the energy as fast and may have to pay a higher price for the energy compared to competitors.Another important factor of Ripples marketing mix is its promotion. This is because they have to promote how environmentally friendly this energy is compared to others. This will help attract more customers and target those who wish to be more environmentally friendly. This will help to increase their sales as more people are aware of how environmentally friendly they are.\r\n", "awarded_marks": 10, "total_marks": 12.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": "{0: [0], 1: [1, 4], 2: [8, 5], 3: [9, 12]}", "start_time": 1724445792.089749, "llm_graded_answer": "The candidate begins by discussing the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix, noting that it helps Ripple compete by offering lower prices based on customer energy usage. This demonstrates an understanding of the role of price in attracting customers (AO1b). The candidate also mentions that price helps determine the amount of energy a customer receives, which can enhance customer loyalty and sales, showing some application to the business context (AO2).\n\nIn the second paragraph, the candidate introduces the importance of place, explaining that the location of turbines affects productivity and efficiency, which in turn impacts pricing and customer attraction. This shows an attempt to deconstruct business information and find interconnected points (AO3a). However, the explanation lacks depth and logical consistency, as it does not fully explore the implications of place on Ripple's overall strategy.\n\nThe candidate then discusses promotion, highlighting the need to promote Ripple's environmentally friendly energy to attract customers. This demonstrates an understanding of another element of the marketing mix and its relevance to Ripple's business (AO1b). However, the evaluation is somewhat superficial and does not provide a thorough analysis of how promotion interacts with price and place in Ripple's marketing strategy (AO3b).\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates mostly accurate knowledge and understanding of business concepts, with appropriate use of business terminology in places.

They highlight how these tanks were faster and more powerful, and how they played a crucial role in breaking through German lines. The student also notes the limitations of earlier tanks, providing a balanced view of the technology's evolution. This analysis is again supported by contextual knowledge, making it a thorough evaluation of the source's content.\n\nThe student attempts to evaluate the provenance of both sources, noting that Source B is a picture published in a British newspaper and Source C is an excerpt from a book written by a tank commander. However, the evaluation of provenance is not as developed as the content analysis. The student could improve by discussing the potential biases and reliability of these sources, such as the purpose of the newspaper picture to boost morale or the personal perspective of the tank commander.\n\nThe conclusion attempts to link both sources together, stating that they show the importance of technology and tactics in the First World War. However, this could be more explicitly tied to the question of utility for a historian. The student should emphasize how these sources provide valuable insights into the evolution of military technology and tactics, and how they reflect the changing nature of warfare during the conflict.\n\nOverall, the answer demonstrates developed evaluation of the content of both sources, supported by contextual knowledge. To reach the highest level, the student should provide a more complex evaluation of the provenance and explicitly link the sources to their utility for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.\n\nOverall, the answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 9 marks.", "llm_graded_answer_token_costing": {"burn_in_runs": 1, "model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 24679, "prompt_token_cost": 0.123395, "completion_tokens": 412, "completion_cost": 0.00618, "total_cost": 0.129575}, "llm_awarded_marks": 9, "llm_awarded_marks_token_costing": {"burn_in_runs": 1, "model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 450, "prompt_token_cost": 0.00225, "completion_tokens": 1, "completion_cost": 1.5e-05, "total_cost": 0.0022649999999999997}, "end_time": 1724445884.416665, "elapsed_time_in_seconds": 8.60828423500061}, {"subject_id": "aqa_history", "question_id": 3.0, "question_type": "hs_analyse", "student_id": 5080, "question_text": "Write an account of how the Schlieffen Plan led to problems in 1914.", "mark_scheme_text": "Level_4:\n  description: \n    - Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 8\n    minimum: 7\n  criteria:\n    - Extends Level 3\n  progression:\n    - Students may progress from a developed narrative of causation/consequence with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding which might be related, for example, to an analysis of how/why tension increased at different stages and/or showing understanding about how much each part of the sequence increased tension and led to a crisis.\n  example_answer: \n    - 'the success of the Schlieffen Plan depended on the speed of its execution but the Germans failed to defeat France within the planned timescale of 6 weeks.

For example, the use of single quotation marks around \"Germany, Italy and Russia\" and \"Britain, France and Belgium\" is unconventional. Additionally, the sentence \"But because Serbia didn't want any Austro-Hungarian police in their country, so Austria-Hungary started preparing for war.\" has an unnecessary conjunction \"so\" after the comma.\n\n2. **Grammar:**\n   - The student uses grammar with general control of meaning. The overall meaning is clear, but there are some grammatical issues. For example, the sentence \"But because Serbia didn't want any Austro-Hungarian police in their country, so Austria-Hungary started preparing for war.\" is grammatically incorrect due to the redundant conjunction \"so.\"\n   - Another example is the sentence \"Austria-Hungary knew it was Serbia so they began talks.\" which could be clearer if rephrased to \"Austria-Hungary knew it was Serbia, so they began talks.\"\n\n3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**\n   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as \"alliance system,\" \"triple entente,\" \"triple alliance,\" and \"assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\" These terms are appropriate and relevant to the topic.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe student's answer demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, with only minor errors that do not significantly hinder the overall meaning. The grammar is generally controlled, though there are a few areas that could be improved for clarity.

The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners.

When Britian Russia and France signed the Triple Entente in retaliation of the Triple Alliance Germany used it to complain that they were being circled in. The Triple entente was used to make Germany back down but could of been a factor for war. Once the two sides were created it was clear War was imminent but Germany and its allies were keen for war then in contrast France and Russia and Britain made a pact us Allience to detterent Germany.\n\nHowever the assasination os archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbia's black hand Gang also was a jumpstart to war. After the Assassin Austria-Hungery blamed Serbia and had intellignce the Black hand Gang was helped by the Serb government this gave the kaiser a motivation for war due to it alliance with Austria - Hungery. The Austrian government gave Serbia a 10 point deal which they agreed to all but one (letting Austrian soldiers into Serbia). Within a\n\ndays War was declared. Russia was dragged in due to its alliance with Serbia and the Germans started there Schlieffen plan in the West turning the Balkans war to a world war.\n\nFinally the Moroccan Crisis was another reason why Germany were happy for a war to start.\nFrance wanted to take over Morocco but Germany also wanted to expand its empire so the kaiser sent a warship into the ports of Morocco to show Germany wanted to be part of World affairs too. The French were outraged and a meeting in Algeciras (Spain) with the USA, Britain, Germany and France calmed the situation down preventing early war. The kaiser did this to see how Sent France could be pushed but Germany was humiliated when Britain Supported France due to there alliance. In 1911 the French were called into Morocco to settle a rebellion but Germany accused France of invading the country. Ultimately it was declared France would take full control of Morocco which humiliated the Kaiser for a Second time.

Source B shows a artillery barrage which was the tactic the British used to make advances on the German trenches. An Artillery Barrage would consist of shooting multiple rounds of artillery on a set timetable at different distances to provide British troops in No Man's Land cover from any enemy defenses allowing the troops to cross No Man's Land with greater ease leading to a greater number of attacks onto German trenches. This source shows how tactics evolved throughout the war as they had thought of a more viable way of crossing No Man's Land with less German threat. Source C shows the evolution of tanks. At the start of World War 1 tanks were sent out on their own slowly, not posing much of threat to the enemy, but throughout the war tanks became one of the greatest threats to an enemy due to their improved speed and tactics used around them. The creeping barrage was one of the most successful tactics used at war. This would consist of sending out around a dozen tanks onto No man's land with hundreds of soldiers behind them. The soldiers behind would be safe to another German defenses because of the tanks blocking any bullets, also creating an easier way into enemy trenches because tanks would destroy any barbed wire in its way. Tanks would also have 360 machine guns attached to the top allowing it to send cover fire at German's.", "awarded_marks": 7, "total_marks": 12.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": "{0: [0], 4: [10, 12], 3: [9, 7], 2: [4, 6], 1: [1, 3]}", "start_time": 1724446009.923403, "llm_graded_answer": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and their relevance to military technology and tactics in the First World War. They provide a detailed analysis of Source B, explaining the concept of an artillery barrage and how it was used to protect advancing troops. This shows a good grasp of the tactics used and how they evolved to increase the effectiveness of attacks on enemy trenches.\n\nFor Source C, the student explains the development and use of tanks, particularly the 'Whippets,' and how they were employed to counter German threats during the Spring Offensive. They highlight the evolution of tank tactics from the beginning of the war to the later stages, showing how tanks became a significant threat due to their improved speed and the tactics used around them.\n\nThe student also mentions the 'creeping barrage' tactic, although this is not directly referenced in the sources provided. This shows an understanding of the broader context of military tactics during the war, even if it is not directly supported by the sources.\n\nHowever, the student does not explicitly evaluate the provenance of the sources, which is necessary for a higher-level response. They do not discuss the reliability or perspective of the sources, such as the fact that Source B is a newspaper picture from 1917, which might have been intended to boost public morale, or that Source C is a post-war account by a tank commander, which might be influenced by personal experiences and hindsight.\n\nOverall, the answer demonstrates developed evaluation of the content of both sources and shows good contextual knowledge.

The Germans tested the entente cordiale between France and Britain at the Morocco crisis. France wanted to colonise Morocco, Britain agreed and allowed France to do this. However Germany decided to see how strong the alliance was and defended Morocco from being colonised which created the tension between the entente cordiale and Germany. Tension between Russia and Austria rose during the Balkan crisis. Austria had annexed Bosnia which upset Serbia who asked their Slavic brothers Russia to defend them if war happened between Serbia and Austria. Austria had asked Germany for support after hearing this news leading Germany sending Austria a 'Blank Cheque' meaning they will defend Austria no matter what strengthening their alliance.\n\nIn conclusion, Alliance had a huge part to play in the beginning of World War 1 but so did power wanted by leaders who wanted to grow their empires.", "awarded_marks": 6, "total_marks": 16.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": "{0: [0], 4: [16, 12], 3: [9, 12], 2: [8, 5], 1: [1, 4]}", "start_time": 1724446073.779341, "llm_graded_answer": "The student begins by addressing the given factor, the alliance system, and provides a brief explanation of how alliances contributed to the tensions leading up to the First World War.

The Germans tested the entente cordiale between France and Britain at the Morocco crisis. France wanted to colonise Morocco, Britain agreed and allowed France to do this. However Germany decided to see how strong the alliance was and defended Morocco from being colonised which created the tension between the entente cordiale and Germany. Tension between Russia and Austria rose during the Balkan crisis. Austria had annexed Bosnia which upset Serbia who asked their Slavic brothers Russia to defend them if war happened between Serbia and Austria. Austria had asked Germany for support after hearing this news leading Germany sending Austria a 'Blank Cheque' meaning they will defend Austria no matter what strengthening their alliance.\n\nIn conclusion, Alliance had a huge part to play in the beginning of World War 1 but so did power wanted by leaders who wanted to grow their empires.", "awarded_marks": 3, "total_marks": 4.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": "{4: [4], 3: [2, 3], 2: [1], 1: [0]}", "start_time": 1724446089.779222, "llm_graded_answer": "Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**\n   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:\n     - \"lead\" should be \"led\" in \"the alliance system lead to starting of the First World War.\"\n     - \"entente cordiale\" should be capitalized as \"Entente Cordiale.\"\n     - \"Morocco crisis\" should be \"Moroccan Crisis.\"\n     - \"Balkan crisis\" should be \"Balkan Crisis.\"\n     - \"World War 1\" should be \"World War I.\"\n   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some issues:\n     - Missing comma after \"Firstly.\"\n     - Missing comma after \"In conclusion.\"\n     - The sentence \"Firstly many of the powerful nations believed an alliance led to even greater power for both countries.\" could be clearer with a comma after \"Firstly.\"\n\n2. **Grammar:**\n   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some areas for improvement:\n     - \"Alliance had a huge part to play\" should be \"The alliance system had a huge part to play.\"\n     - \"power wanted by leaders\" should be \"the power sought by leaders.\"\n     - \"Germany sending Austria a 'Blank Cheque'\" should be \"Germany sent Austria a 'Blank Cheque.'\"\n\n3. **Specialist Terms:**\n   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as \"entente cordiale,\" \"Moroccan Crisis,\" \"Balkan Crisis,\" \"annexed,\" and \"Blank Cheque.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe student demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, with some minor errors that do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.

This is a valid risk for investors in a wind farm, as the profitability and reliability of their investment depend on consistent energy production.\n   - The context supports this risk because Ripple is a wind farm, and wind energy generation is inherently dependent on weather conditions. If there is no wind, the wind farm cannot generate energy, which could affect the return on investment for the investors.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple by pointing out the dependency on wind for energy generation.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "Option 2 would have a more significant impact on the success of Ripple because increased amount of free training for employees will allow the workers to know how to run the service and provide maintenance if it's faulty or broken.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": NaN, "awarded_marks": 0, "total_marks": 12.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": "{0: [0], 1: [1, 4], 2: [8, 5], 3: [9, 12]}", "start_time": 1724446272.0659359, "llm_graded_answer": "No Answer is provided.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy.

If it is not windy, the wind farm may not generate enough energy, which could impact the return on investment for the investors.\n   - The context mentions that Ripple is a wind farm, and the energy supply is based on wind conditions. Therefore, the risk of not having enough wind to generate energy is a valid concern for investors.\n   - The mark scheme example answers include risks such as \"Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs,\" which is similar to the risk implied by the answer. The lack of wind directly affects energy production, which in turn affects the energy supply to investors' homes or businesses.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The answer \"What if it is not windy one day\" successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, as it highlights the dependency on wind conditions for energy production.\n- This risk is supported by the context, which explains that Ripple's energy supply is based on wind farm production.\n\n### Marks Awarded:\n- The answer fulfills the criteria of stating one risk for investors in Ripple.\n- Therefore, 1 mark should be awarded.\n\n**Total Marks: 1/1**", "llm_graded_answer_token_costing": {"burn_in_runs": 1, "model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 648, "prompt_token_cost": 0.00324, "completion_tokens": 313, "completion_cost": 0.004695, "total_cost": 0.007935000000000001}, "llm_awarded_marks": 1, "llm_awarded_marks_token_costing": {"burn_in_runs": 1, "model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 351, "prompt_token_cost": 0.001755, "completion_tokens": 1, "completion_cost": 1.5e-05, "total_cost": 0.00177}, "end_time": 1724446747.103014, "elapsed_time_in_seconds": 5.02880597114563}, {"subject_id": "edexcel_business_studies", "question_id": 7.2, "question_type": "bs_identify", "student_id": 5106, "question_text": "Using the information in Table 4, identify which type of energy use declined the most between 2018 and 2019.", "mark_scheme_text": "marking_criteria:\n  - Award mark if the example answer is mentioned exactly (case insensitive).\nexample_answers:\n  - Coal\ntotal_marks:\n  - 1", "questions_with_marking_level_flag": NaN, "context": NaN, "answer_text": "Coal has decreased the most by 2.8, and Renewables has increased by 3.8", "awarded_marks": 1, "total_marks": 1.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": NaN, "start_time": 1724446748.108146, "llm_graded_answer": "Let's evaluate the given answer against the mark scheme criteria step-by-step.\n\n### Mark Scheme Criteria:\n- **Award mark if the example answer is mentioned exactly (case insensitive).**\n\n### Example Answer:\n- **Coal**\n\n### Answer Provided:\n- **\"Coal has decreased the most by 2.8, and Renewables has increased by 3.8\"**\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n1. **Award mark if the example answer is mentioned exactly (case insensitive).**\n   - The provided answer states, **\"Coal has decreased the most by 2.8\"**.\n   - The term **\"Coal\"** is mentioned exactly as required by the mark scheme.\n   - Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The answer correctly identifies **\"Coal\"** as the type of energy use that declined the most between 2018 and 2019.\n- The additional information about the amount of decrease and the increase in renewables does not affect the correctness of the identification.\n\n### Marks Awarded:\n- **1 mark** (out of 1 possible mark)\n\nThe answer successfully meets the criteria set out in the mark scheme and should be awarded the full mark.", "llm_graded_answer_token_costing": {"burn_in_runs": 1, "model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 388, "prompt_token_cost": 0.00194, "completion_tokens": 237, "completion_cost": 0.003555, "total_cost": 0.005495}, "llm_awarded_marks": 1, "llm_awarded_marks_token_costing": {"burn_in_runs": 1, "model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 275, "prompt_token_cost": 0.001375, "completion_tokens": 1, "completion_cost": 1.5e-05, "total_cost": 0.00139}, "end_time": 1724446751.7546282, "elapsed_time_in_seconds": 3.646482229232788}, {"subject_id": "edexcel_business_studies", "question_id": 7.3, "question_type": "bs_outline", "student_id": 5106, "question_text": "Outline one benefit to customers from Ripple asking questions to identify its customer needs.", "mark_scheme_text": "marking_criteria:\n  - Benefit to customers of Ripple\nexample_answers:\n  - Customers will receive the correct green energy plan (1)\n  - This will make sure they receive the correct amount of energy for their needs (1)\n  - Customers will invest the correct amount of money into the wind farm (1)\n  - This will lead them to get the best return on their money (1)\n  - Any other valid answer with linked development and evidence of application (1)\nmarking_notes:\n  - Award up to 2 marks for linked points outlining a benefit to customers of Ripple.\n  - Award a maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.\n  - To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application.\ntotal_marks:\n  - 2", "questions_with_marking_level_flag": NaN, "context": "Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK.
