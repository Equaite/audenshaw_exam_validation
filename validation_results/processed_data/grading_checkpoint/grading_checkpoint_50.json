The statement \"You deal and finance with the problems directly\" is vague and does not align with the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n\n- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**\n  - Since the candidate did not identify a clear advantage, there is no explanation provided. The statement \"You deal and finance with the problems directly\" does not explain any specific advantage of a private limited company. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n\n### Example Answers Comparison:\n- The example answers provide clear advantages such as \"The owners would have limited liability\" and \"The business can sell shares to raise finance,\" followed by detailed explanations. The candidate's response does not provide a comparable level of clarity or detail.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The candidate's response does not meet any of the marking criteria.

Let's evaluate the response against the marking criteria:\n\n- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:\n  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, \"A smaller business means a lower reputation so that means they'll attract less foot traffic in person.\" This suggests that the business might not rely on physical location due to lower foot traffic. This identification is somewhat implicit but can be credited as it aligns with the idea of using the internet to mitigate the need for a physical presence.\n  - **Mark: 1**\n\n- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:\n  - The candidate explains the way by stating, \"but can possibly use a website to promote because a lot of advertisement is done digitally.\" This explanation indicates that the business can use the internet for digital promotion, which can affect its location choice.\n  - However, the explanation lacks depth. It does not fully develop the idea of how using a website for promotion can influence the business's location choice, such as choosing a cheaper location or not requiring a physical retail location.\n  - **Mark: 1**\n\nThe candidate's response has identified a way and provided a basic explanation, but it lacks the depth and development needed for full marks.

Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany. Then Germany invaded Belgium bringing Britain into the war as it triggered the 1843 treaty of London which Britain vowed to protect Belgium from invading forces. Because of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's death,Europe was involved in an all-out war.\n\nIn 1871, shortly after Germany's unification, Germany and Austria-Hungary made an alliance together as they both shared similar cuteral identities,had shared the same common language of German and were politically close to each other. Later, the Italians joined the dual alliance to form the triple alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. In 1892, France and Russia formed an alliance together.
