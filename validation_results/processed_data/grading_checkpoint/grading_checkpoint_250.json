The statement \"You deal and finance with the problems directly\" is vague and does not align with the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n\n- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**\n  - Since the candidate did not identify a clear advantage, there is no explanation provided. The statement \"You deal and finance with the problems directly\" does not explain any specific advantage of a private limited company. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n\n### Example Answers Comparison:\n- The example answers provide clear advantages such as \"The owners would have limited liability\" and \"The business can sell shares to raise finance,\" followed by detailed explanations. The candidate's response does not provide a comparable level of clarity or detail.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The candidate's response does not meet any of the marking criteria.

Let's evaluate the response against the marking criteria:\n\n- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:\n  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, \"A smaller business means a lower reputation so that means they'll attract less foot traffic in person.\" This suggests that the business might not rely on physical location due to lower foot traffic. This identification is somewhat implicit but can be credited as it aligns with the idea of using the internet to mitigate the need for a physical presence.\n  - **Mark: 1**\n\n- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:\n  - The candidate explains the way by stating, \"but can possibly use a website to promote because a lot of advertisement is done digitally.\" This explanation indicates that the business can use the internet for digital promotion, which can affect its location choice.\n  - However, the explanation lacks depth. It does not fully develop the idea of how using a website for promotion can influence the business's location choice, such as choosing a cheaper location or not requiring a physical retail location.\n  - **Mark: 1**\n\nThe candidate's response has identified a way and provided a basic explanation, but it lacks the depth and development needed for full marks.

Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany. Then Germany invaded Belgium bringing Britain into the war as it triggered the 1843 treaty of London which Britain vowed to protect Belgium from invading forces.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "I think option 1 is more suitable by reducing the tax paid by a small business.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "In order to help small business, the government should consider to reduce the tax paid by small businesses. This would lead to small businesses giving less tax and use the money to cover total cost, staffs, wages/salary, or use the money to improve the products or services they aid.

As a result of this, the business may fail.\n\nAnother reason is that the money the small businesses have left over, they could use that money to help charities or people in need.

On the other hand Source C is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the first World War because, the Source is talking about tanks and their new versions, this is useful as it is showing how the British went from tanks that were sent out in ones which led to them being easily picked out and broken by tanks being upgraded and being sent out in groups of 7's, 10, 20's etc, due to the tanks being sent out in groups this led to mass destruction and caused the German soldiers to be scared, it also nullified things such as barbed wire as the tanks could just go over them and flatten them causing the soldiers to be able to easily pass through without being cut, the tanks also provided cover, due to their size and speed multiple soldiers could follow from behind, and the tanks were also upgraded from just having a big cannon that took a long time to turn to having machine guns at the top that could turn a whole 360\u00b0, this is useful as it shows the evolution in weapons.", "awarded_marks": 9, "total_marks": 12.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": "{0: [0], 4: [10, 12], 3: [9, 7], 2: [4, 6], 1: [1, 3]}", "start_time": 1724444647.0150359, "llm_graded_answer": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and provides a detailed analysis of their content. For Source B, the student explains the tactic of artillery barrage and how it was used to create a barrier for soldiers, pushing back the enemy until the trench was reached. The student also evaluates the provenance by noting that the source was published by a British newspaper, which might present the tactic as flawless. This shows an understanding of potential bias, which is a key aspect of evaluating the usefulness of a source.\n\nFor Source C, the student describes the evolution of tank technology and tactics, explaining how newer tanks like the 'Whippets' were faster, more numerous, and equipped with machine guns, which made them more effective in battle. The student also notes the impact of these tanks on the battlefield, such as their ability to flatten barbed wire and provide cover for soldiers. This detailed analysis of the content, combined with the understanding of the source's provenance (a first-hand account by a tank commander), makes the evaluation comprehensive.\n\nHowever, the student could improve by explicitly linking the content and provenance to the utility for historians more consistently. For example, they could state more clearly how the first-hand account in Source C provides a reliable perspective on the effectiveness of tanks, or how the British newspaper's portrayal in Source B might influence public perception of military tactics.\n\nOverall, the answer demonstrates developed evaluation of both sources based on content and provenance, with extended reasoning related to utility. Therefore, this answer falls into Level 3 and should be awarded 9 marks.

If there is insufficient wind, the wind farm will not generate energy, which directly impacts the investors who rely on this energy supply.\n   - The risk is clearly articulated and directly related to the context of Ripple's business model, which depends on wind energy to supply its customers.\n\n### Evidence from the Context:\n- The context mentions that Ripple is a wind farm providing green energy. The dependency on wind is implicit in the nature of a wind farm.\n- The answer aligns with the context as it highlights a potential operational risk (lack of wind) that could affect energy production and, consequently, the return on investment for the investors.\n\n### Comparison with Example Answers:\n- The example answers provided in the mark scheme include risks such as \"Loss of money invested in the wind farm\" and \"Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy.\"\n- The given answer is similar in nature as it identifies a specific operational risk that could lead to a failure in energy production, which is a valid concern for investors.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, specifically the risk associated with the variability of wind, which is essential for energy production in a wind farm.\n- This risk is directly relevant to the context of Ripple's business model and fits within the scope of the marking criteria.\n\n### Marks Awarded:\n- **1 mark** (out of 1 possible mark)\n\nThe answer meets the criteria set out in the mark scheme and provides a clear and relevant risk for investors in Ripple.", "llm_graded_answer_token_costing": {"burn_in_runs": 1, "model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 662, "prompt_token_cost": 0.00331, "completion_tokens": 405, "completion_cost": 0.006075, "total_cost": 0.009385}, "llm_awarded_marks": 1, "llm_awarded_marks_token_costing": {"burn_in_runs": 1, "model": "gpt-4o", "prompt_tokens": 443, "prompt_token_cost": 0.002215, "completion_tokens": 1, "completion_cost": 1.5e-05, "total_cost": 0.0022299999999999998}, "end_time": 1724444830.814528, "elapsed_time_in_seconds": 4.564198970794678}, {"subject_id": "edexcel_business_studies", "question_id": 7.2, "question_type": "bs_identify", "student_id": 5025, "question_text": "Using the information in Table 4, identify which type of energy use declined the most between 2018 and 2019.", "mark_scheme_text": "marking_criteria:\n  -

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "The price at Ripple is better than its competitors which allows it to be more cost effective for people who sign up for Ripple and they are also helping the environment as well as Ripple is an eco-friendly company which creates zero emissions.

This tactic worked majority of the times, but had one big problem. The shells were going so close that if they were fired wrong then they would kill their own soldiers.\n\nSource C is useful to a historian because it talks about the development of tanks. At first tanks were slow which made them an easy target for the germans. The british used the tanks in large groups followed by soldiers. The tanks would provide cover for soldiers and they could destroy barbed wire so the troops could get through later on tanks were improved they were faster and better weapons on board for example bigger shells and turrets.

Due to a Serbian group called 'Black Hand' the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Franz Ferdinand) was assainated in Sarajevo. This caused massive tension between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia however Serbia was close allies with Russia and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia. Austria-Hungary asked Germany if they would back them up and Germany agreed to do so. This caused tension between Germany and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Moroccan Crisis had a big effect on why the first word war began. France wanted Control of Morocco and with Britain and France being allies, Britain encouraged France to do so. The German Kaiser wanted an Empire and so taking Morocco would be a good start. He believed Germany should have Morocco and he even visited it. A Conference took place in Algiers to decide who should have Morocco. Most Countries agreed France should take control and Germany was humiliated. The Kaiser was furious and tensions were rising between France and Germany.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "The place of where there windmills are important as it is located in a remote area of South Wales. This means the customers can receive energy elsewhere and not be disturbed by the large windmills. This opportunity seems desirable as the members won't be disturbed and they feel that they are improving the environment.\r\n\r\nThe method of the customers being promoted to members of the business is very simple. This makes it more convenient for the people which is also a customer's need. Making promotion more convenient for customers allows Ripple to add value to their service meaning they can increase profit which leads to further future success in the business.\r\n\r\nThis is very important as \r\n\r\nThe way Ripple produces their energy is through renewable energy. As it mentions, it doesn't harm the environment but keeps it a healthier place. This is important because it stands out as their USP. Having a USP makes their business stand out amongst the market, which will attract customers. They can increase members paying for their service which leads to an increase in revenue. This increase in revenue is important as they can use the extra money on further development for the business.\r\n\r\nRipple is flexible with the way the price of their energy plans are set at. The amount of money customers can invest varies on their energy needs. This Is beneficial to the customers as they won't need to pay a fixed price where they could be wasting money. Also, Ripple claims their services are cheaper than other competitors. This will attract customers because customers aim to find the best value for their money. Ripple's pricing is crucial as it gives the customers a choice. This will lead to an increase in members because of the vast options they offer.\r\nTo conclude, Ripple's marketing mix helps form the type of business that they are. It will definitely help them in the survival of their business\r\n", "awarded_marks": 3, "total_marks": 12.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": "{0: [0], 1: [1, 4], 2: [8, 5], 3: [9, 12]}", "start_time": 1724445262.9362078, "llm_graded_answer": "The candidate's response covers several aspects of Ripple's marketing mix, but it lacks focus on the importance of price specifically.

Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy.

For example, Source B shows a new tactic developed in the war called a creeping barrage this is when artillery from very far behind shoot in front of their own men and the explosions give cover and make it easy for them to advance toward enemy trenches. Australia were very known for using this tactic and were very good at it, they would get really close to the artillery fire and advance very quickly. Source C is also useful to a historian as it is written by a tank commander which means it very reliable, another reason why source C is helpful is it showcases a newly developed weapon and illustrates how significant it was in the first world war. The source tells a short story on Frank Mitchell and how he was stuck bound to be attacked when seven of their newest, fastest tanks raced past called 'wippets'. The source also says about the tanks machine guns which had also been worked on alot during the first world war, the original machine gun the 'vickers gun' was very heavy so was mostly used stationary with a crew of six men operating it the new machine gun the lewis gun was much lighter and very easy to be operated by 1-2 men and was the first development of the assault rifle.

For Source B, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and its effectiveness, mentioning Australia's proficiency with this tactic. This shows a clear understanding of the military tactics used during the First World War. For Source C, the student highlights the reliability of the source due to its author being a tank commander and provides a detailed account of the new tank technology, specifically the 'Whippets' and their impact on the battlefield. The student also discusses the development of machine guns, comparing the Vickers gun and the Lewis gun, which adds depth to the analysis.\n\nHowever, the evaluation of the provenance of Source B is missing, and the evaluation of Source C's provenance could be more developed. The student does not explicitly link the content and provenance to the utility of the sources for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of both sources, including a discussion of their provenance and how it affects their utility. Additionally, the student should evaluate the relationship between the sources and how they together provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nOverall, the answer falls into Level 3 due to the developed evaluation of the content of both sources and the extended reasoning related to utility.

The answer does not explicitly link these events to the broader problems that arose, such as the stalemate on the Western Front or the prolonged nature of the war.\n\nTo reach Level 3, the student would need to provide a more structured and well-ordered narrative that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding relevant to the question.

In the late 19th century France and Russia as well as Austria-Hungary and Germany allied to protect themselves from each other in case of a war.
