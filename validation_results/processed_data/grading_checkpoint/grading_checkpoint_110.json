The statement \"You deal and finance with the problems directly\" is vague and does not align with the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n\n- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**\n  - Since the candidate did not identify a clear advantage, there is no explanation provided. The statement \"You deal and finance with the problems directly\" does not explain any specific advantage of a private limited company. Therefore, this criterion is not met.\n\n### Example Answers Comparison:\n- The example answers provide clear advantages such as \"The owners would have limited liability\" and \"The business can sell shares to raise finance,\" followed by detailed explanations. The candidate's response does not provide a comparable level of clarity or detail.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The candidate's response does not meet any of the marking criteria.

Let's evaluate the response against the marking criteria:\n\n- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:\n  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, \"A smaller business means a lower reputation so that means they'll attract less foot traffic in person.\" This suggests that the business might not rely on physical location due to lower foot traffic. This identification is somewhat implicit but can be credited as it aligns with the idea of using the internet to mitigate the need for a physical presence.\n  - **Mark: 1**\n\n- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:\n  - The candidate explains the way by stating, \"but can possibly use a website to promote because a lot of advertisement is done digitally.\" This explanation indicates that the business can use the internet for digital promotion, which can affect its location choice.\n  - However, the explanation lacks depth. It does not fully develop the idea of how using a website for promotion can influence the business's location choice, such as choosing a cheaper location or not requiring a physical retail location.\n  - **Mark: 1**\n\nThe candidate's response has identified a way and provided a basic explanation, but it lacks the depth and development needed for full marks.

Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany. Then Germany invaded Belgium bringing Britain into the war as it triggered the 1843 treaty of London which Britain vowed to protect Belgium from invading forces.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "I think option 1 is more suitable by reducing the tax paid by a small business.

It is the country\u2019s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer\u2019s home or business. Ripple\u2019s business plan fits in with the UK government\u2019s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.", "answer_text": "In order to help small business, the government should consider to reduce the tax paid by small businesses. This would lead to small businesses giving less tax and use the money to cover total cost, staffs, wages/salary, or use the money to improve the products or services they aid.

As a result of this, the business may fail.\n\nAnother reason is that the money the small businesses have left over, they could use that money to help charities or people in need.

On the other hand Source C is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the first World War because, the Source is talking about tanks and their new versions, this is useful as it is showing how the British went from tanks that were sent out in ones which led to them being easily picked out and broken by tanks being upgraded and being sent out in groups of 7's, 10, 20's etc, due to the tanks being sent out in groups this led to mass destruction and caused the German soldiers to be scared, it also nullified things such as barbed wire as the tanks could just go over them and flatten them causing the soldiers to be able to easily pass through without being cut, the tanks also provided cover, due to their size and speed multiple soldiers could follow from behind, and the tanks were also upgraded from just having a big cannon that took a long time to turn to having machine guns at the top that could turn a whole 360\u00b0, this is useful as it shows the evolution in weapons.", "awarded_marks": 9, "total_marks": 12.0, "answer_id": NaN, "linked_answer_id": NaN, "topic_id": NaN, "answer_scanned_image": NaN, "level_structure": "{0: [0], 4: [10, 12], 3: [9, 7], 2: [4, 6], 1: [1, 3]}", "start_time": 1724444647.0150359, "llm_graded_answer": "The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and provides a detailed analysis of their content. For Source B, the student explains the tactic of artillery barrage and how it was used to create a barrier for soldiers, pushing back the enemy until the trench was reached. The student also evaluates the provenance by noting that the source was published by a British newspaper, which might present the tactic as flawless. This shows an understanding of potential bias, which is a key aspect of evaluating the usefulness of a source.\n\nFor Source C, the student describes the evolution of tank technology and tactics, explaining how newer tanks like the 'Whippets' were faster, more numerous, and equipped with machine guns, which made them more effective in battle. The student also notes the impact of these tanks on the battlefield, such as their ability to flatten barbed wire and provide cover for soldiers. This detailed analysis of the content, combined with the understanding of the source's provenance (a first-hand account by a tank commander), makes the evaluation comprehensive.\n\nHowever, the student could improve by explicitly linking the content and provenance to the utility for historians more consistently. For example, they could state more clearly how the first-hand account in Source C provides a reliable perspective on the effectiveness of tanks, or how the British newspaper's portrayal in Source B might influence public perception of military tactics.\n\nOverall, the answer demonstrates developed evaluation of both sources based on content and provenance, with extended reasoning related to utility. Therefore, this answer falls into Level 3 and should be awarded 9 marks.
