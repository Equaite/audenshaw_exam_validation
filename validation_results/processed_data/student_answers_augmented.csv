```","In source B, we can see an image displaying the tradectory of artillery bombardments. The allies use the cover created by the smoke and explosions to advance through no-mans land with the element of surprise. This allowed it so that the enemy would have a difficult time discerning where the enemy were attacking from. This form of tactical manouvering is known as a 'creeping barrage'. The allies would time artillery bombardment at certain angles and simultaneously the soldiers would 'creep in'.

Tanks were first introduced in the battle of the Somme 1916, but were largely inneffective as they were slow (only reaching speeds of 4 mph), many tactics were

not developed for them as the British thought of not much use for them. But by 1917 and 1918, tanks were being deployed in large rows of 200-300 tanks which would cross over no-mans land and destroy the barbed wire defences. In source C, we see the mention of machine guns on the tanks as they were added as a way to bring more firepower. These machine guns were mounted on and could turn 360 degrees to inflict damage upon the enemies.",12,,,,

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was heavily reliant on Russia taking a long time to mobilize and a very quick and decisive win against France (in 40 days). The plan was to have a large bulk of the German army invade France by cutting into Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to surprise the French, who would be anticipating an attack directly into France on the boarder between them. However, the Schlieffen plan failed as Russia only took 10 days to mobilize (faster than expected) and Belgium put up a fierce and resistance fight against the Germans (much more resistance than Germany had anticipated). Ultimately, invading through Belgium only helped the stalemate last longer as Britain was forced to join the war effort as invading Belgium initiated an 1843 treaty of London where Britain vowed to protect Belgium. This prolonged the war significantly, turning 40 days into 4 years.

Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany.

Because of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's death,Europe was involved in an all-out war.

racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B it shows the British Soilders advancing under an artillery barrage. The british Soilder were running in waves all in different waves. this is because they cannot be in any artillery barage. you can see that all the soilders are running and still alive and not getting under an artillery barage. Each wave protects you from a plane and from bombs dropping on you.

In Source C it Shows that the german Soilder were preparing an attack on the british tank, but then 7 of the newest and fastest tanks named whippets came and drove straight into the german Soilders and scattered them in all directions, which this had destroyed the German threat. This helps the students studying military technology understand about how fast and powerful the Whippet was.

This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence. This was to see how far France would push. And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows a depiction of the Western Front with two types of new technology and tactics being shown. The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. 

Source C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C 
describes how the army constantly made new prototypes 
as the tanks so they could be faster and cause 
more casualties. This meant there was less hand to 
hand fighting because of the tanks physiological and 
devastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C 
is useful to a historian because it has personal 
story from someone actually experiencing the power 
of tanks, showing how the threat they brought. ",12,,,,

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan already had some problems to it, even before it was put into practise. For example it relied on the slow mobilisation of Russia. As the Germans would find out, the Russian army mobilised in just 10 days and had already consigned plans to attack in the East. This meant the Germans would have to fight a war on two fronts, exactly what was trying to be avoided. Furthermore after the death of Alfred Von Schlieffen in 1913, the next general made the army smaller for the assault on France, and also missed Holland from the plan entirely. This meant the Germans would have a weaker force in battle, additioning to them having to divide there army in half to fight in two fronts.

The German plan also relied on Belgium’s invasion which they thought would be quick and easy. However, the Belgian army put up stiff resistance trying forts and its small army, slowing down the German advancement. This gave France and Russia time to communicate and mobilise. Furthermore the German army underestimated the pact Britain had with Belgium in the 1890's, supporting its neutralaty. Therefore when they invaded Belgium and entered through France, The BEF was sent out to stop the Germany army. to May 1914 France and the BEF fought the Germans at the battle of Mons, contributing to stalemate the failure of the Schielfen plan.",8,,,,
