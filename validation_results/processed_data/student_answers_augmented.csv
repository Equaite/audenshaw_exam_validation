The allies use the cover created by the smoke and explosions to advance through no-mans land with the element of surprise. This allowed it so that the enemy would have a difficult time discerning where the enemy were attacking from. This form of tactical manouvering is known as a 'creeping barrage'. The allies would time artillery bombardment at certain angles and simultaneously the soldiers would 'creep in'.

Tanks were first introduced in the battle of the Somme 1916, but were largely inneffective as they were slow (only reaching speeds of 4 mph), many tactics were

not developed for them as the British thought of not much use for them. But by 1917 and 1918, tanks were being deployed in large rows of 200-300 tanks which would cross over no-mans land and destroy the barbed wire defences. In source C, we see the mention of machine guns on the tanks as they were added as a way to bring more firepower.

    - 'the success of the Schlieffen Plan depended on the speed of its execution but the Germans failed to defeat France within the planned timescale of 6 weeks. The Germans underestimated the resolve and reaction times of its enemies. However, whilst the Germans were not successful in their primary objective, neither were they entirely defeated. When both sides sought to protect the territory gained by digging trenches, stalemate resulted.'

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was heavily reliant on Russia taking a long time to mobilize and a very quick and decisive win against France (in 40 days). The plan was to have a large bulk of the German army invade France by cutting into Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to surprise the French, who would be anticipating an attack directly into France on the boarder between them. However, the Schlieffen plan failed as Russia only took 10 days to mobilize (faster than expected) and Belgium put up a fierce and resistance fight against the Germans (much more resistance than Germany had anticipated). Ultimately, invading through Belgium only helped the stalemate last longer as Britain was forced to join the war effort as invading Belgium initiated an 1843 treaty of London where Britain vowed to protect Belgium. This prolonged the war significantly, turning 40 days into 4 years.

  example_answer: 
    - 'the success of the Schlieffen Plan depended on the speed of its execution but the Germans failed to defeat France within the planned timescale of 6 weeks. The Germans underestimated the resolve and reaction times of its enemies. However, whilst the Germans were not successful in their primary objective, neither were they entirely defeated. When both sides sought to protect the territory gained by digging trenches, stalemate resulted.'

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B, the picture shows a section Of British soldiers advencing under artilery bourrage. The picture was published in a British newspaper and and could be an awareness to show the changes of technology to the citizens of great Britain. In this case, the changes in technology could be the artillery due to its raw increase accuracy and fire rate. Another charge in technology was fighter planes. The way that the fighter get could damage people and find them was due to a savee secret compartment where they could throw bombs out of it creating the havoc among the soilders on the groud. Some planes had a camera attached to the plane so it could take a birds eye view picture to find and locate the exact co-ordinates to attack them. However, In Source C It tells the reader about a tank operator called Frank Mitchell who is writing about his experiences in the spring offensive in 1918. He was describing his experiences using tanks and how powerful they could be. They quickly destroyed German trench. Shows how this new machine could stop anything in its track and even was a defense mechanism to stop the new machine guns.

To an Historian these & other sources are both useful in there own use. Source B describes the way artillery barrage had become worse and more accurate to the enemy soldiers. Source C also shows the way new technology such as tanks can help the opposition win the war.",5,12,,,,,"{0: [0], 4: [10, 12], 3: [9, 7], 2: [4, 6], 1: [1, 3]}"

This was the second issue the creation of trenches led to a stalemate. During this thousands of men died but no land was taken due to periods of heavy artillery fire.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B, the picture depicts a array of soldiers - most likely to be on the Allied forces - crossing over no man's land with shells firing over them at a constant rate. Contextually we know that during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the battle of Passchendaele. In 1917, the British forces were able to tactically redirected the way they used artillery by creating a creeping barrage where in a certain order a certain amount of shells could be fired upfront at the troops to clear any enemy ground/territory, which provided as a explosive shield which now able to give them easier access towards the trench for bayonett charging. This was vital to break the stalemate as a historian can gather the fact that the German forces were overwhelmed at the change in fire rate which  was able to will thousand more proving to be more effective. Due to the smoke after the

explosion, the Germans couldn't also see the advancing troops in front of them which caused major distress. Source C brings the idea of tanks into the question which was a revolutionary idea at the time as there was anything like it. In September 1916 the first battalion of tanks were deployed into the Battle of the Somme which allowed for the ease of movement to continue. Trenches had become ineffective for the Germany as they could have just been ran over. Barbed wire which was a massive problem until this point also became ineffective as tanks could have just flattened them causing no distress from when explosives blew them up which only led to them becoming noisy. The tanks had a 360 turret which was later developed which could shoot from anywhere. In the Battle of Cambrai, 1917 they were able to use the tanks for a circular formation in rows as the Battle of the Somme let only 50 tanks remaining from the 400 used. Towards the end of the war which was a vital asset for the allied victory as the Germans could really fight back.

Number one was that sometime before the war, France had created the Maginot line to protect himself from Germany if they were to ever attack again. This meant Germany had to divert for Belgium. However, in 1839 the Treaty of London was signed with Britain giving full support for Belgium as they gained independence from any country willing to attack them. This meant if Germany diverted for Belgium they would face a double threat with Britain joining the war. The Belgian army too would be employed adding resistance towards the Germans. On the Eastern side, Russia before the war was able to muster up men in the course of 4 weeks which wasn't apart of Germany plan as they assumed Russia would be the attack as a surprise. This led to a war on two fronts. The BEF also came in time to support the invasion before the Germans got to Paris.",8,8,,,,,"{0: [0], 4: [8, 7], 3: [5, 6], 2: [3, 4], 1: [1, 2]}"

    - N/A",,"The alliance system in the first World War and the years building up to that was vital for the causes and the actual outcome of the war. I agree with this statement as there were many factors for this argument including: The Brothers alliance, Dual alliance which turned to the Triple alliance and the Entente Cordiale/Entente Alliance. In the late 19th century France and Russia as well as Austria-Hungary and Germany allied to protect themselves from each other in case of a war. The entente cordiale in 1904 was also another reason why tensions fired up with the old Entente and Germany due to the Moroccan crisis. These two events and their conferences started a clear divide in those countries listed as France wanted more colonies however this was disrupting the Kaiser's Weltpolitik which was his world view and the way he wanted to grow his empire doing this by trying to help at Morocco. In the Balkans the tension between the alliances of the Balkan League and the Ottoman empire stirred up causingfor two wars which left that are with nonstop raising tensions. Russia and Serbia had a brotherhood alliance as they were both Slavic. Bosnia another slavic county was going to get annexed by austria (which already had previous tensions with Russia). This angered the Serbains leading the Russians backing them up in justification of a war. The Germans however were not happy with this giving Austria a blank check allowing them for help whenever they need it also giving Russia a ultimatum to stop and back out of Autria-Hungary and Serbian tensions which they desired. 

Another alliance between the French and the Belgians also stopped and aggrovated German plans for WWI in attacking france Belgian led to Britain joining the war which would become a burden for the Kaiser. This caused a massive divide in the Nations of Europe which was a factor of the July crisis which ultimately ended up with the start of world war one. In conclusion we can see that the build up of allinnces between certain countries in Europe and Asia (Japanese and the British) led to a mess as various problems were split through various different nations. This includes Italy who was originally part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria but however to unprecedented events switched to the Entente side by the start of the war.

I agree with this statement as there were many factors for this argument including: The Brothers alliance, Dual alliance which turned to the Triple alliance and the Entente Cordiale/Entente Alliance. In the late 19th century France and Russia as well as Austria-Hungary and Germany allied to protect themselves from each other in case of a war. The entente cordiale in 1904 was also another reason why tensions fired up with the old Entente and Germany due to the Moroccan crisis. These two events and their conferences started a clear divide in those countries listed as France wanted more colonies however this was disrupting the Kaiser's Weltpolitik which was his world view and the way he wanted to grow his empire doing this by trying to help at Morocco. In the Balkans the tension between the alliances of the Balkan League and the Ottoman empire stirred up causingfor two wars which left that are with nonstop raising tensions. Russia and Serbia had a brotherhood alliance as they were both Slavic. Bosnia another slavic county was going to get annexed by austria (which already had previous tensions with Russia). This angered the Serbains leading the Russians backing them up in justification of a war. The Germans however were not happy with this giving Austria a blank check allowing them for help whenever they need it also giving Russia a ultimatum to stop and back out of Autria-Hungary and Serbian tensions which they desired. 

Another alliance between the French and the Belgians also stopped and aggrovated German plans for WWI in attacking france Belgian led to Britain joining the war which would become a burden for the Kaiser. This caused a massive divide in the Nations of Europe which was a factor of the July crisis which ultimately ended up with the start of world war one. In conclusion we can see that the build up of allinnces between certain countries in Europe and Asia (Japanese and the British) led to a mess as various problems were split through various different nations. This includes Italy who was originally part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria but however to unprecedented events switched to the Entente side by the start of the war.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows a depiction of the Western Front with two types of new technology and tactics being shown. The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. 

Source C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C 
describes how the army constantly made new prototypes 
as the tanks so they could be faster and cause 
more casualties. This meant there was less hand to 
hand fighting because of the tanks physiological and 
devastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C 
is useful to a historian because it has personal 
story from someone actually experiencing the power 
of tanks, showing how the threat they brought. ",9,12,,,,,"{0: [0], 4: [10, 12], 3: [9, 7], 2: [4, 6], 1: [1, 3]}"

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan already had some problems to it, even before it was put into practise. For example it relied on the slow mobilisation of Russia. As the Germans would find out, the Russian army mobilised in just 10 days and had already consigned plans to attack in the East. This meant the Germans would have to fight a war on two fronts, exactly what was trying to be avoided. Furthermore after the death of Alfred Von Schlieffen in 1913, the next general made the army smaller for the assault on France, and also missed Holland from the plan entirely. This meant the Germans would have a weaker force in battle, additioning to them having to divide there army in half to fight in two fronts.

The German plan also relied on Belgium’s invasion which they thought would be quick and easy. However, the Belgian army put up stiff resistance trying forts and its small army, slowing down the German advancement. This gave France and Russia time to communicate and mobilise. Furthermore the German army underestimated the pact Britain had with Belgium in the 1890's, supporting its neutralaty. Therefore when they invaded Belgium and entered through France, The BEF was sent out to stop the Germany army. to May 1914 France and the BEF fought the Germans at the battle of Mons, contributing to stalemate the failure of the Schielfen plan.",8,8,,,,,"{0: [0], 4: [8, 7], 3: [5, 6], 2: [3, 4], 1: [1, 2]}"

    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

    - Students can progress to this level by demonstrating thorough and detailed understanding with logically connected reasoning and clear justifications.
  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

Also, if the business has trained staff, they won't need to try and hire staff without training meaning they won't break any laws in the employment laws, so they won't be fined, meaning they save money and their reputation as a business.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",Price is very important as the business is competing to be the cheapest supplier of renewable energy as well as charging a fair price for both the customer and the business as running and maintaining wind turbines is expensive.,1,12,,,,,"{0: [0], 1: [1, 4], 2: [8, 5], 3: [9, 12]}"

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy.

  progression:
    - Students can progress to this level by demonstrating a basic understanding of business concepts and making simple connections between points.

  progression:

  example_answer: 
    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  progression:
    - Students can progress to this level by demonstrating thorough and detailed understanding with logically connected reasoning and clear justifications.
  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
