    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.

I think Sources
B and C are very useful to 
a historian studying military 
technology and tactics in the 
First World War as in 
Source B it shows us British 
soldiers advancing under an artillery 
barrage. This was called the creeping 
barrage. The creeping barrage was used
to destroy anything infront of 
the soldiers then they would 
all follow in clearing up the 
rest including the tanks going in.
Source C is also useful as it 
shows how big of a difference tanks 
made in war as they could 
quickly destroy through German 
soldiers and smash through anything 
in its path.","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides a basic analysis of their content. For Source B, the student mentions the ""creeping barrage"" tactic and explains its purpose. For Source C, the student highlights the effectiveness of tanks, specifically the ""Whippets,"" in combat. However, the analysis lacks depth and detailed contextual knowledge. The student does not evaluate the provenance of the sources or provide extended reasoning related to their utility.

To improve, the student should:
1. Provide more detailed contextual knowledge about the creeping barrage and the role of tanks in the First World War.
2. Evaluate the provenance of the sources, such as the reliability and perspective of a British newspaper in 1917 and the firsthand account of a tank commander.
3. Offer extended reasoning on how these sources are useful to historians studying military technology and tactics.

The response is presented as general statements and does not provide a structured account or detailed analysis of causation and consequence.

The student identifies that Germany wanted an empire and that this led to an increase in military power, which caused concern among other global powers. However, the answer does not explain how the Schlieffen Plan itself led to specific problems in 1914, such as the invasion of Belgium, the involvement of Britain, or the eventual stalemate on the Western Front.

The explanation is simple and does not reach the level of complexity required for higher marks.

The student also mentions the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand as another cause of the war, but this explanation is brief and lacks depth. The connection to the Alliance System is not clearly explained, and the reasoning is not fully developed.

### Spelling and Punctuation
- **Spelling**: The student generally spells words correctly. However, there are a few minor errors:
  - ""goverment"" should be ""government""
  - ""Britains'"" should be ""Britain's""
- **Punctuation**: The punctuation is mostly accurate, but there are some issues:
  - The comma after ""built"" in the first sentence is unnecessary.
  - The sentence ""they Britain and France both promised to attack if Germany tried to invade Belgium and try to keep them out."" is awkwardly punctuated and structured.

### Grammar
- **Grammar Control**: The student demonstrates a good grasp of grammar, but there are some errors:
  - ""built made tensions high"" should be ""built up tensions"" or ""made tensions high"".
  - ""this also built tension"" should be ""this also increased tension"".
  - ""they Britain and France both promised"" should be ""Britain and France both promised"".
  - ""Britains' France's or Russia's allies or colonies"" should be ""Britain's, France's, or Russia's allies or colonies"".

### Use of Specialist Terms
- The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Triple Entente"", ""assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand"", and ""allies"".

### Analysis
- **Level 1 Criteria**: The student does not meet the criteria for Level 1 as there are several spelling and grammatical errors, and the punctuation is not consistently accurate.
- **Level 2 Criteria**: The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning, and employs a good range of specialist terms. However, the errors present prevent it from being considered ""considerable accuracy"".
- **Level 3 Criteria**: The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, and any errors do not significantly hinder meaning overall. The range of specialist terms is limited but present.

Given the student's performance, the answer fits best within **Level 3**. The errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar are present but do not severely hinder the overall meaning. The use of specialist terms, while not extensive, is adequate.

This represents the allies frustration against russia and especially the bolsheviks as they left the war and had signed a peace treaty with Germany giving up significant portions of valueable land.
","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the Bolshevik dragging Russia towards Germany and the German Kaiser eagerly watching in the background. They also provide some contextual knowledge about the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the signing of the peace treaty with Germany. However, the analysis is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not fully explain how these features are critical of the Bolsheviks or provide extended reasoning supported by detailed factual knowledge.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to develop their analysis further by explaining how the cartoon is critical of the Bolsheviks, such as by discussing the implications of Russia's withdrawal from the war and the impact on the Allies. They should also provide more detailed factual knowledge to support their points.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B, we can see an image displaying the tradectory of artillery bombardments. The allies use the cover created by the smoke and explosions to advance through no-mans land with the element of surprise. This allowed it so that the enemy would have a difficult time discerning where the enemy were attacking from. This form of tactical manouvering is known as a 'creeping barrage'. The allies would time artillery bombardment at certain angles and simultaneously the soldiers would 'creep in'.

Tanks were first introduced in the battle of the Somme 1916, but were largely inneffective as they were slow (only reaching speeds of 4 mph), many tactics were

not developed for them as the British thought of not much use for them. But by 1917 and 1918, tanks were being deployed in large rows of 200-300 tanks which would cross over no-mans land and destroy the barbed wire defences. In source C, we see the mention of machine guns on the tanks as they were added as a way to bring more firepower. These machine guns were mounted on and could turn 360 degrees to inflict damage upon the enemies.","The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the content of both sources and provides some contextual knowledge about military technology and tactics during the First World War. However, the analysis lacks depth and does not fully address the utility of the sources to a historian studying the topic.

For Source B, the student identifies the use of artillery bombardments and the tactic of the 'creeping barrage,' explaining how it provided cover for advancing soldiers. This shows a basic understanding of the source's content and some contextual knowledge. However, the evaluation of the source's utility is not fully developed. The student could have discussed the provenance of the source, such as its publication in a British newspaper in 1917, and how this might affect its reliability and usefulness to historians.

For Source C, the student mentions the introduction of tanks and their development over time, including the addition of machine guns. The description of the 'Whippets' tanks and their effectiveness in battle is accurate, but the analysis lacks depth. The student does not fully evaluate the source's utility, such as considering the author's perspective as a tank commander and the potential biases in his account.

To improve the response, the student should provide a more detailed evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources, explaining how they contribute to our understanding of military technology and tactics during the First World War. Additionally, the student should make more explicit connections between the sources and their utility to historians.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was heavily reliant on Russia taking a long time to mobilize and a very quick and decisive win against France (in 40 days). The plan was to have a large bulk of the German army invade France by cutting into Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to surprise the French, who would be anticipating an attack directly into France on the boarder between them. However, the Schlieffen plan failed as Russia only took 10 days to mobilize (faster than expected) and Belgium put up a fierce and resistance fight against the Germans (much more resistance than Germany had anticipated). Ultimately, invading through Belgium only helped the stalemate last longer as Britain was forced to join the war effort as invading Belgium initiated an 1843 treaty of London where Britain vowed to protect Belgium. This prolonged the war significantly, turning 40 days into 4 years.
","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer identifies key elements of the plan, such as the reliance on Russia's slow mobilization and the quick defeat of France, and explains how these expectations were not met. The student mentions the unexpected speed of Russia's mobilization and the strong resistance from Belgium, which are accurate and relevant points.

The answer also highlights the involvement of Britain due to the 1843 Treaty of London, which is a significant consequence of the German invasion of Belgium. This shows an understanding of how the Schlieffen Plan led to broader problems, including the prolongation of the war.

However, the analysis could be more developed. The student does not fully explore the impact of these events on the overall war effort or the resulting stalemate on the Western Front.

The alliances were the main trigger for many of the events, wars and crises that led up to world war one. The black hand (a terrorist group) assasinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the heir to the austrian-hungarian throne) leaving only serbia to blame for the assasination. Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany. Then Germany invaded Belgium bringing Britain into the war as it triggered the 1843 treaty of London which Britain vowed to protect Belgium from invading forces. Because of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's death,Europe was involved in an all-out war.

In 1871, shortly after Germany's unification, Germany and Austria-Hungary made an alliance together as they both shared similar cuteral identities,had shared the same common language of German and were politically close to each other. Later, the Italians joined the dual alliance to form the triple alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. In 1892, France and Russia formed an alliance together. This was a threat towards Germany as it meant they could be attacked from either the East or the West. Later in 1904, Britain formed an alliance with France, known as the Entente Cordiale (Friendly alliance). Then in 1906, Britain, France and Russia all came together to form the triple Entente. The alliance system made political disputes more intense as one disagreement could lead to a major war. This is clearly seen in the Moroccan crisises and the Balkan wars. The involvement of this many countries made it impossible to avoid an all  out war from breaking out in Europe, thus causing the start of World War One.","The student provides a detailed explanation of the alliance system and its role in escalating tensions leading to World War I. They accurately describe the sequence of events following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and how the alliances triggered a chain reaction of war declarations. This demonstrates a good understanding of the stated factor and its impact.

The second paragraph further elaborates on the formation of the alliances, providing specific details about the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente. The student explains how these alliances created a situation where political disputes could easily escalate into major conflicts, referencing the Moroccan crises and the Balkan wars as examples. This shows a developed explanation of the stated factor and its broader implications.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing other factors that contributed to the outbreak of World War I, such as militarism, imperialism, and nationalism. Including these factors and comparing their significance to the alliance system would provide a more balanced and comprehensive analysis, potentially elevating the answer to level 4.

Overall, the answer falls into level 3 due to the developed explanation of the alliance system and its role in causing World War I. The student demonstrates accurate knowledge and understanding, with a coherent and logical structure. To reach level 4, the answer would need to include a complex explanation of other factors and a sustained judgement.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors such as ""assasinated"" (should be ""assassinated""), ""austrian-hungarian"" (should be ""Austro-Hungarian""), ""cuteral"" (should be ""cultural""), and ""crisises"" (should be ""crises"").
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some missing commas and periods that could improve readability. For example, ""Europe was divided in two different camps"" could use a comma after ""camps"" to separate the clauses more clearly.
   - The use of parentheses is correct, but the sentence structure around them could be improved for clarity.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall. The meaning is clear, but there are some awkward phrasings and run-on sentences that could be improved. For example, ""Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one"" could be rephrased for better clarity.
   - There are some minor grammatical errors, such as ""Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany"" which could be more clearly written as ""Germany declared war on Russia, and France declared war on Germany.""

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""alliance system,"" ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Austro-Hungarian throne,"" ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""triple Entente,"" ""Moroccan crises,"" and ""Balkan wars.""
   - These terms are used appropriately and demonstrate a good understanding of the historical context.

**Conclusion:**
- The student demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, though there are a few errors.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning, but there are some awkward phrasings and minor grammatical errors.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

However, the analysis is somewhat confused and lacks clarity. The student mentions the term ""Betrayed"" and attempts to explain it, but the explanation is not accurate or coherent. There is a misunderstanding about the context and the roles of the Bolsheviks and Russia during WWI. The student does not provide any factual knowledge or understanding related to the features of the source, which is necessary for a developed analysis.

To improve, the student should focus on explaining how the cartoon is critical of the Bolsheviks by providing accurate historical context, such as the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and the subsequent peace treaty with Germany in 1918, which allowed Germany to concentrate its forces on the Western Front. This would demonstrate a better understanding of the source and its critical nature.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B it shows the British Soilders advancing under an artillery barrage. The british Soilder were running in waves all in different waves. this is because they cannot be in any artillery barage. you can see that all the soilders are running and still alive and not getting under an artillery barage. Each wave protects you from a plane and from bombs dropping on you.

In Source C it Shows that the german Soilder were preparing an attack on the british tank, but then 7 of the newest and fastest tanks named whippets came and drove straight into the german Soilders and scattered them in all directions, which this had destroyed the German threat. This helps the students studying military technology understand about how fast and powerful the Whippet was. In source B shows how useful and how good the strategy was used by the british soldiers were they could run across the battlefield without dying this helps the student studying Military technology.

","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student notes that British soldiers are advancing under an artillery barrage and explains the tactic of running in waves to avoid being hit by artillery. For Source C, the student describes how the new Whippet tanks scattered German soldiers and eliminated the threat, highlighting the effectiveness of this new technology.

However, the analysis lacks depth and detailed contextual knowledge. The student does not provide extended reasoning or evaluate the provenance of the sources. For example, they could have discussed the significance of Source B being published in a British newspaper in 1917, possibly as propaganda to boost morale. Similarly, they could have evaluated the reliability of Source C, considering it was written by a tank commander who participated in the battle and was awarded a medal for bravery.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed factual knowledge, evaluate the provenance of the sources, and offer extended reasoning related to their utility.

### Mark Scheme Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - Correct formula: \( \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Cost per Unit}} \)
   - Substitution: \( \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = 2,500 \) units
   - Decrease: \( 4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \) units

2. **Final Answer:**
   - Correct final answer: 1,500 units

### Provided Answer Analysis:
1. **Initial Calculation:**
   - \( £10,000 / 250 = 400 \)
     - This calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be \( £10,000 / (6.50 - 2.50) = £10,000 / 4 = 2,500 \) units.

2. **Subsequent Calculations:**
   - \( 6.50 \times 4,000 = 26,000 \)
   - \( 5.00 \times 4,000 = 20,000 \)
     - These calculations are correct but irrelevant to the break-even analysis.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - \( 2,000 \) units
     - This is incorrect. The correct decrease should be \( 4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \) units.

### Grading:
- **Substitution into correct formula:** The provided answer does not show the correct substitution into the break-even formula. No marks can be awarded for this part.
- **Final Answer:** The final answer is incorrect.

However, the mark scheme encourages awarding marks for correct working even if the final answer is incorrect. The provided answer does not demonstrate the correct working towards the break-even calculation, so no partial credit can be awarded based on the mark scheme.

  - 6",,By a small business meeting its legal obligations this could make people want to work for a business by following a legal obligation like employee's wage or discrimination. or even paying them on time.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one advantage'. The candidate has suggested an advantage through ""this could make people want to work for a business by following a legal obligation like employee's wage or discrimination."" However, the explanation is not fully developed. Let's break down the response according to the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage**: The candidate identifies an advantage by stating, ""this could make people want to work for a business by following a legal obligation like employee's wage or discrimination."" This aligns with the example answer, ""Employees will feel that the business is taking good care of them."" Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage**: The candidate does not fully develop the explanation. The statement ""or even paying them on time"" is an attempt to explain but lacks depth. The response does not clearly link how meeting legal obligations leads to a more motivated workforce or increased productivity, as seen in the example answers. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied. (0 marks)

Overall, the candidate has identified an advantage but has not sufficiently explained it.

The candidate has suggested an advantage through 'By a business using retained profit as a source of finance it gain profit it makes them instead of having to pay the money back and borrowing it.' Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate identifies an advantage by stating that using retained profit means the business does not have to pay the money back. This aligns with the example answer ""Interest is not paid on retained profit"" and ""Retained profit is a cheap source of finance."" Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

- **Explaining the advantage:**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the advantage by mentioning that the business does not have to borrow money and thus avoids repayment.

The explanation is not as developed as the example answer ""The business would not experience an increase in costs"" or ""The owner(s) keep full control of all decisions made since no new shares are issued.""

Let's evaluate it against the marking criteria:

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The candidate does not directly address how financial information in the business plan could help forecast success. Instead, they focus on the unique selling point (USP) and word-of-mouth recommendations, which are not directly related to financial forecasting. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points mentioned by the candidate are not well-linked. The response mentions the USP and potential savings on advertising costs but does not connect these points to financial forecasting or the business plan. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked and the response does not directly address the role of financial information in forecasting success, the answer can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

### Example Answers Comparison:

- The example answers provided in the mark scheme clearly link financial information (like cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis) to the potential success of the business. The candidate's answer does not make such a connection.

### Contextual Evidence:

- The candidate mentions the USP and word-of-mouth recommendations, which are part of the context, but these points are not linked to financial forecasting. Therefore, the context is not effectively used to address the question.

This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence. This was to see how far France would push. And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support.

Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state.","To assess the student's answer, we will evaluate it against the criteria provided in the Mark Scheme for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG). We will also consider the use of specialist terms.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""Morrocan"" should be ""Moroccan.""
     - ""Morroco"" should be ""Morocco.""
     - ""britian"" should be ""Britain.""
     - ""rebillion"" should be ""rebellion.""
     - ""tukey"" should be ""Turkey.""
   - Punctuation is generally used correctly, but there are some issues:
     - The sentence ""This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence."" is a run-on sentence and could be broken down for clarity.
     - The phrase ""And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support."" starts with ""And,"" which is generally discouraged in formal writing.
     - The sentence ""Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state."" lacks clarity and proper punctuation.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student demonstrates a general control of grammar, but there are some issues:
     - The phrase ""which this had France wanted to take over Morroco"" is grammatically incorrect and confusing.
     - The sentence ""And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support."" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammatical correctness.
     - The sentence ""Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state."" is awkwardly constructed and could be clearer.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses some specialist terms such as ""Moroccan crisis,"" ""kaiser,"" and ""allies,"" but the range is limited.

### Conclusion:
- The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, but there are several spelling errors and some punctuation issues.
- The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, but there are errors that hinder clarity.
- The student uses a limited range of specialist terms.

Based on the criteria in the Mark Scheme, the student's performance aligns most closely with **Level 3**:
- **Level 3: Threshold performance**
  - Learners spell and punctuate with reasonable accuracy.
  - Learners use rules of grammar with some control of meaning and any errors do not significantly hinder meaning overall.
  - Learners use a limited range of specialist terms as appropriate.

  - The challenge of setting up a plumbing business in Birmingham, where competition is high, could be a driving force for Amelia (AO2).
  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).
  - As a result, she would be determined to succeed as there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. This could give her an extra incentive to do well. (AO3a).
  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

    - []","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",One of her non-financial aims was that she wanted this as a way of women to get relatively closer with women doing their work in their house.,"The candidate's response is very limited and lacks depth. The answer identifies a non-financial aim, ""she wanted this as a way of women to get relatively closer with women doing their work in their house,"" but does not develop this point further. There is no detailed application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2). Additionally, the response does not deconstruct business information or issues, nor does it find interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a).

Given the lack of development and analysis, the response fits the criteria for Level 1. The candidate has made an attempt to address the question but has not provided sufficient detail or logical connections to move beyond the lowest level.

- The answer is somewhat related to the ""Product"" element but lacks clarity and explicit mention.

### Final Mark

Based on the evaluation, the answer does not fully meet the criteria to be awarded a mark. It lacks the explicit mention of an element of the marketing mix and does not clearly align with the example answers provided.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer does not provide linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. The response states, ""Because many female customers feel that they can relate more easily with doing repairs in their house,"" which is more about customer preference rather than a reason for government interest. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The response does not link points to outline a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. It only mentions a customer preference without connecting it to government interests such as tax collection or employment. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for linked points and can only be considered for a maximum of 1 mark.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers in the mark scheme provide clear reasons why the government would want the business to be successful, such as tax collection or employment opportunities. The given answer does not align with these examples as it does not address government interests.

**Marking Notes:**
- The marking notes specify that to award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. The given answer lacks both linked development and application to government interests.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",I think Lili heating LTD should consider option 1 which is offer a discounted price to female customers. This is because if a woman gets a discount this could be forwarded to other women which is another way of promoting a business by people sharing it and telling friends and family. This could help towards promoting a business. Overall this will lead to an increase in profit and having an increase in profit for Lili heating LTD is good as she has just started and will not need to struggle of survival. And option 2 that doesn't help as much as option 1 towards business growth.,"The candidate begins by stating that Lili Heating Ltd should choose option 1, which is to offer a discounted price to female customers. This is followed by a justification that focuses on the potential for word-of-mouth promotion, which is a valid business concept. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed application of business concepts and issues to the specific context of Lili Heating Ltd (AO2). 

The analysis (AO3a) is limited, as the candidate does not provide interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The argument is somewhat repetitive and does not explore the potential drawbacks or alternative perspectives in detail. 

The evaluation (AO3b) is also limited, as the candidate provides a simple judgement without a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made. The conclusion is brief and does not add significant value to the argument.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited understanding and application of business concepts, with basic analysis and minimal justification.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",This can make one person own a share in a lot depending on how much. So a person can own more of a share.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""And they can lose out on more and can go bankrupt as they are a small business.""
   - This statement identifies a potential risk for investors, which is the possibility of losing their investment and going bankrupt. This aligns with the example answer ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm (1)"" from the mark scheme.
   - The context supports this risk as it mentions that customers invest money into the wind farm, and if the business fails, they could lose their investment.

### Conclusion:
The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, which is the potential loss of their investment and the possibility of going bankrupt. This satisfies the marking criteria.

This will be favorited by people. People will recommend this business and people will use their services. This will lead into an increase in profit, as they are a small business.","The candidate's response needs to be evaluated against the marking criteria and example answers provided in the mark scheme. Here is the detailed commentary:

### Marking Criteria:

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The candidate mentions, ""This will create a green energy plan to establish how much a customer should invest into Ripple."" This aligns with the context provided, as Ripple asks questions to identify customer needs and then creates a green energy plan. This is a benefit to the customer as it ensures they invest the correct amount of money.
  - However, the candidate then states, ""This will be favorited by people. People will recommend this business and people will use their services. This will lead into an increase in profit, as they are a small business."" This part of the response shifts focus from the benefit to customers to the benefit to the business, which is not what the question asks for.

### Example Answers:

- The example answers focus on direct benefits to the customers, such as receiving the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs. The candidate's response partially aligns with this by mentioning the creation of a green energy plan but does not fully develop the benefit to the customer.

### Marking Notes:

- **Award up to 2 marks for linked points outlining a benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The candidate's response does not fully develop the benefit to the customer. The initial point about creating a green energy plan is valid but lacks further development on how this benefits the customer directly.
  
- **Award a maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the candidate's response are not well-linked. The shift in focus to the business's profit and recommendations by people does not directly address the benefit to the customer.

- **To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The response lacks linked development and does not provide sufficient evidence of application to the customer's benefit.

### Conclusion:

- The candidate's response partially addresses the benefit to customers by mentioning the creation of a green energy plan. However, it lacks further development and shifts focus to the business's benefits, which is not relevant to the question.
- Therefore, the response should be awarded 1 mark for mentioning the creation of a green energy plan but not fully developing the benefit to the customer.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

They state that reducing the tax paid by Ripple will increase profit, which is a valid point, but they do not provide detailed reasoning or context-specific examples to support this claim. 

**Application (AO2):**
- The candidate mentions Ripple as a small business and the impact of reduced tax on profit, which shows some understanding of the business context. However, the application is limited and lacks detail. This places AO2 in Level 1.

**Analysis (AO3a):**
- The candidate's analysis is very basic. They mention that reduced tax will lead to increased profit but do not explore the implications or provide interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. This places AO3a in Level 1.

**Evaluation (AO3b):**
- The candidate makes a simple judgement that reducing tax is beneficial for Ripple, but the justification is limited and lacks thorough evaluation of business information and issues. This places AO3b in Level 1.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",this will help the business from not being able to struggle if the price is right ig its a good price people will recommend it to other people and this will help the business growth by telling family and friends can help to lead into an increase in profit.,"The candidate's response is very limited and lacks depth.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B, the picture shows a section Of British soldiers advencing under artilery bourrage. The picture was published in a British newspaper and and could be an awareness to show the changes of technology to the citizens of great Britain. In this case, the changes in technology could be the artillery due to its raw increase accuracy and fire rate. Another charge in technology was fighter planes. The way that the fighter get could damage people and find them was due to a savee secret compartment where they could throw bombs out of it creating the havoc among the soilders on the groud. Some planes had a camera attached to the plane so it could take a birds eye view picture to find and locate the exact co-ordinates to attack them. However, In Source C It tells the reader about a tank operator called Frank Mitchell who is writing about his experiences in the spring offensive in 1918. He was describing his experiences using tanks and how powerful they could be. They quickly destroyed German trench. Shows how this new machine could stop anything in its track and even was a defense mechanism to stop the new machine guns.

To an Historian these & other sources are both useful in there own use. Source B describes the way artillery barrage had become worse and more accurate to the enemy soldiers. Source C also shows the way new technology such as tanks can help the opposition win the war.","The student begins by describing the content of Source B, noting that it shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage. They suggest that the publication of the picture in a British newspaper could be to raise awareness among British citizens about technological advancements, specifically in artillery. The student also mentions fighter planes and their capabilities, although this is not directly related to Source B, which focuses on artillery.

In the second paragraph, the student discusses Source C, which is an account by Frank Mitchell, a tank commander, describing the effectiveness of tanks during the German Spring Offensive in 1918. The student highlights how the new 'Whippet' tanks were able to quickly destroy German threats, showcasing the power and utility of tanks in warfare.

The student attempts to evaluate the usefulness of both sources to a historian, noting that Source B shows the increased accuracy and fire rate of artillery, while Source C demonstrates the effectiveness of tanks. However, the evaluation is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not fully explore the provenance of the sources or provide detailed contextual knowledge to support their evaluation.

To improve this answer and reach a higher level, the student should:

1. **Develop the Evaluation of Provenance:**
   - For Source B, discuss the significance of the source being published in a British newspaper in 1917. Consider the impact of wartime censorship and propaganda on the portrayal of military technology and tactics.
   - For Source C, evaluate the reliability of Frank Mitchell's account, considering his role as a tank commander and the fact that the book was published after the war. Discuss how his firsthand experience and potential biases might affect the usefulness of the source.

2. **Provide More Contextual Knowledge:**
   - For Source B, include more specific details about the use of artillery and its development during the First World War. Mention key battles where artillery played a crucial role and how tactics evolved over time.
   - For Source C, provide additional context about the development and deployment of tanks during the war. Discuss the impact of tanks on trench warfare and how they were perceived by both sides.

3. **Evaluate the Relationship Between the Sources:**
   - Discuss how the two sources together provide a more comprehensive understanding of military technology and tactics during the First World War. Highlight the differences and similarities in the portrayal of technological advancements and their impact on the war.

Overall, this answer falls into Level 2 due to its simple evaluation of the content and limited analysis of provenance. It should be awarded 5 marks.

The main two alliances were the triple alliance which involved Germany Austria-Hungary, and Italy and the 'triple Entente' consisted of Russia, France and Britain. The morrocon Crisis could also include the alliances because it forced Britain to get involved when Germany decided to ignore there heed of war. The collapse of the Ottoman empire could also be a cause of the main cause. because Austria Hungary attacked Serbia it got Russia involved and then got Germany involved due to their alliance.

The way Germany handed a 'blank cheque' over to Austria-Hungary could also have started the argument or the main cause due to it presenting almost a brotherhood to both countries making them a powerful combination.

In my opinion, the alliances is a massive factor of the first World war and It is in fact the main cause, however it also shows how both alliances divided to fight against each other and how the other countries composed of loyalty but also betrayal. ","The student begins by acknowledging the Alliance System as a cause of the First World War but also mentions other potential causes. This introduction sets up the potential for a complex explanation, but the execution falls short.

The first paragraph provides a basic explanation of the Alliance System, mentioning the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente. However, the explanation lacks depth and specific factual knowledge. The mention of the Moroccan Crisis is relevant but not well-explained or connected to the Alliance System in a meaningful way.

The second paragraph briefly touches on the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the involvement of Russia and Germany due to alliances. This is a relevant point but is not developed or substantiated with detailed knowledge.

However, there were several other parts that could also be called the ""main cause."" These parts can could conform of Keiser Wilhehms thirst for power and global domination to the morocco crisis between France and Germany.

The main two alliances were the triple alliance which involved Germany Austria-Hungary, and Italy and the 'triple Entente' consisted of Russia, France and Britain. The morrocon Crisis could also include the alliances because it forced Britain to get involved when Germany decided to ignore there heed of war. The collapse of the Ottoman empire could also be a cause of the main cause. because Austria Hungary attacked Serbia it got Russia involved and then got Germany involved due to their alliance.

The way Germany handed a 'blank cheque' over to Austria-Hungary could also have started the argument or the main cause due to it presenting almost a brotherhood to both countries making them a powerful combination.

In my opinion, the alliances is a massive factor of the first World war and It is in fact the main cause, however it also shows how both alliances divided to fight against each other and how the other countries composed of loyalty but also betrayal. ","### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Spelling:
- ""world"" should be capitalized as ""World"" in ""First world war.""
- ""Keiser Wilhehms"" should be ""Kaiser Wilhelm's.""
- ""morocco"" should be ""Moroccan.""
- ""morrocon"" should be ""Moroccan.""
- ""there"" should be ""their"" in ""ignore there heed of war.""
- ""alliances is"" should be ""alliances are.""
- ""first World war"" should be ""First World War.""

#### Punctuation:
- Missing comma after ""Germany"" in ""Germany Austria-Hungary.""
- Missing comma after ""France"" in ""Russia, France and Britain.""
- Missing period at the end of ""the main cause.""
- ""because Austria Hungary attacked Serbia it got Russia involved"" should be ""because Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, it got Russia involved.""
- ""In my opinion, the alliances is a massive factor of the first World war and It is in fact the main cause, however it also shows how both alliances divided to fight against each other and how the other countries composed of loyalty but also betrayal."" is a run-on sentence and should be broken up for clarity.

#### Grammar:
- ""These parts can could conform of"" should be ""These parts could consist of.""
- ""the alliances is"" should be ""the alliances are.""
- ""It is in fact the main cause, however it also shows"" should be ""It is, in fact, the main cause; however, it also shows.""

#### Specialist Terms:
- The answer uses several specialist terms such as ""Alliance System,"" ""Kaiser Wilhelm,"" ""Moroccan Crisis,"" ""Triple Alliance,"" ""Triple Entente,"" ""Ottoman Empire,"" and ""blank cheque.""

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows a attacking technique known as the creeping barrage. Source C is a account from a veteran who fought in spring offensive. These sources are useful for a historian. Source C talks about whippets a new tank. In 1916, when tanks were first used they struggled to break enemy lines. Within 2 years they were able to move quickly into enemy lines. I believe the usage of tanks in the spring offensive was a key reason germany specialised unit, storm troopers, even after artillery fire and mustard gas.

Source B is a propaganda news article showing a new attack the creeping barrage. It was used in Verdun to break the stalemate by providing covers for soldiers. It demonstrates how accurate artillery fire had become and how well timed the army had become. However due to it being British propaganda it hides the issues from the public. For example if any of the timing were of by even a second it could lead to men dieng by there own artillery this happened and hundreds died. Both sources are usefull but they hide the issues with new technology because of the government controll over media in war. ","The student begins by identifying relevant features of both sources, such as the ""creeping barrage"" in Source B and the use of ""Whippets"" tanks in Source C. They provide some contextual knowledge about the development and effectiveness of tanks, mentioning their initial struggles in 1916 and their improved performance by 1918. This shows a basic understanding of the sources and their content.

In the second paragraph, the student evaluates Source B, recognizing it as a propaganda piece and discussing its portrayal of the ""creeping barrage"" tactic. They mention the potential issues with the tactic, such as the risk of friendly fire, which adds some depth to their analysis. However, the evaluation of the provenance is somewhat limited, as it mainly focuses on the source being propaganda without delving into the implications of this in detail.

The evaluation of Source C is less developed. While the student mentions the use of ""Whippets"" tanks and their effectiveness, they do not provide a thorough analysis of the source's content or provenance. The mention of the German Spring Offensive and the role of tanks is a good start, but it lacks the depth and extended reasoning required for higher levels.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the sources and some contextual knowledge, but it lacks the developed evaluation and extended reasoning needed for higher levels. The analysis of provenance is also limited, particularly for Source C.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was a plan to capture paris within 7 weeks so that by the time Russia had mobilised they would only have to fight on one front. However the plan failed due to Belgium resistance and Russia mobilising its army in 15 days.

The first issue this caused was a war on two front west France, east Russia. This meant that Germany was spread thin on supply meaning the soldiers began to starve as they couldn't transport food to 2 fronts. For survival the Germans began to dig trenches so the British and the French did too.

This was the second issue the creation of trenches led to a stalemate. During this thousands of men died but no land was taken due to periods of heavy artillery fire. In addition the trenches condition caused issues as disease spread fast so hundreds died due to a lack of hygiene for example trench foot from the muddy floor and cholera was spread due to flees bitting the infected and spreading it.","The student begins by identifying the Schlieffen Plan and its intended purpose, which was to capture Paris within 7 weeks to avoid a two-front war. They correctly note that the plan failed due to Belgian resistance and the rapid mobilization of Russian forces. This initial explanation moves the answer beyond level 1, as it demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding relevant to the question.

The student then explains the first consequence of the plan's failure: Germany had to fight a war on two fronts, which stretched their resources thin. This explanation shows a simple analysis of causation/consequence, placing the answer in level 2. The mention of soldiers starving due to supply issues and the subsequent digging of trenches by both sides adds to the structured account.

The second issue discussed is the creation of trenches, leading to a stalemate. The student provides specific knowledge about the conditions in the trenches, such as the spread of disease and the impact of heavy artillery fire. This demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding, moving the answer towards level 3.

However, to reach level 4, the answer would need to display complex analysis, including complex sequencing and reasoning. The student would need to show how tension increased at different stages and provide a more detailed narrative of the events. For example, they could discuss how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to the Battle of the Marne and the subsequent entrenchment of both sides, leading to a prolonged stalemate.

For example, countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England began to worry and they began forming alliances with the entene cordial in 1904 with France and England and the triple extent in 1906 with France England and Russia. This ment if any country went to war they would all get dragged in.

The alliances also escalated the balkans crisis into major war as Austria Hungary had been given a blanc check by Germany as they had full suport. It also created tension between Russia (not wanting to look weak) and Germany. Due to Russias pride they refused to step down to Germany. France a russian aly began preparing for war due to Russides actions. Austria would use German engineering to bomb belgrade this was the first bombing of WW1. 

The Alliance caused conflict as other countries wanting to join for example Serbia and Bosnia turned to unite with Russia as they were Slavic Brothers. Bosnia had a revolution against Austria where Arche duke frans ferdinand was assasinated because they wanted to escape Austria's controll and join russia. This led to the to point ultimatum which would be the reason war broke out. Due to the alliance all the countries were dragged in even ones who did nothing in the Balkans crisis.

There would have been less conflict if alliances weren't made.
","The student provides a basic explanation of the stated factor, the Alliance System, and its role in escalating the conflict. They mention the formation of alliances such as the Entente Cordiale and the Triple Entente, and how these alliances meant that if one country went to war, others would be dragged in. This shows some understanding of the alliance system but lacks detailed factual knowledge and developed reasoning.

The student also touches on the Balkans crisis and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, explaining how these events were escalated due to the alliances. They mention the ""blank check"" given by Germany to Austria-Hungary and the involvement of Russia and France, but the explanation is somewhat disjointed and lacks coherence.

The explanation of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the subsequent ultimatum is relevant but again lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge. The student does not fully develop the reasoning behind how these events led to the broader conflict.

Overall, the answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding of the alliance system and other factors but lacks the detailed factual knowledge, coherence, and developed reasoning required for higher levels.

For example, countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England began to worry and they began forming alliances with the entene cordial in 1904 with France and England and the triple extent in 1906 with France England and Russia. This ment if any country went to war they would all get dragged in.

The alliances also escalated the balkans crisis into major war as Austria Hungary had been given a blanc check by Germany as they had full suport. It also created tension between Russia (not wanting to look weak) and Germany. Due to Russias pride they refused to step down to Germany. France a russian aly began preparing for war due to Russides actions. Austria would use German engineering to bomb belgrade this was the first bombing of WW1. 

The Alliance caused conflict as other countries wanting to join for example Serbia and Bosnia turned to unite with Russia as they were Slavic Brothers. Bosnia had a revolution against Austria where Arche duke frans ferdinand was assasinated because they wanted to escape Austria's controll and join russia. This led to the to point ultimatum which would be the reason war broke out. Due to the alliance all the countries were dragged in even ones who did nothing in the Balkans crisis.

There would have been less conflict if alliances weren't made.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, I will assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG) and determine the appropriate level and marks to be awarded.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - Correct spellings: ""extent,"" ""intervene,"" ""forming,"" ""alliances,"" ""escalated,"" ""crisis,"" ""tension,"" ""pride,"" ""refused,"" ""preparing,"" ""engineering,"" ""bomb,"" ""conflict,"" ""revolution,"" ""assassinated,"" ""ultimatum,"" ""reason,"" ""broke,"" ""dragged,"" ""less,"" ""weren't.""
   - Incorrect spellings: ""entene cordial"" (should be ""Entente Cordiale""), ""triple extent"" (should be ""Triple Entente""), ""ment"" (should be ""meant""), ""blanc check"" (should be ""blank check""), ""suport"" (should be ""support""), ""aly"" (should be ""ally""), ""Russides"" (should be ""Russia's""), ""Arche duke frans ferdinand"" (should be ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand""), ""assasinated"" (should be ""assassinated""), ""controll"" (should be ""control""), ""to point"" (should be ""two-point"").
   - The student has several spelling errors, but they do not severely hinder the meaning.

2. **Punctuation:**
   - Correct punctuation: The student uses periods and commas correctly in many places.
   - Incorrect punctuation: 
     - Missing commas for clarity: ""countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England"" (should be ""countries who didn’t intervene with European affairs, like England,"").
     - Inconsistent use of capitalization: ""entene cordial"" (should be ""Entente Cordiale""), ""triple extent"" (should be ""Triple Entente""), ""balkans crisis"" (should be ""Balkans Crisis""), ""Austria Hungary"" (should be ""Austria-Hungary""), ""blanc check"" (should be ""blank check""), ""russian aly"" (should be ""Russian ally""), ""Arche duke frans ferdinand"" (should be ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand""), ""assasinated"" (should be ""assassinated""), ""controll"" (should be ""control""), ""to point"" (should be ""two-point"").
     - Missing apostrophes: ""Russias pride"" (should be ""Russia's pride""), ""Russides actions"" (should be ""Russia's actions"").

3. **Grammar:**
   - Correct grammar: The student generally maintains control of meaning, and the sentences are mostly coherent.
   - Incorrect grammar: 
     - ""countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England"" (should be ""countries that didn’t intervene in European affairs, like England,"").
     - ""This ment if any country went to war they would all get dragged in."" (should be ""This meant that if any country went to war, they would all get dragged in."").
     - ""Austria Hungary had been given a blanc check by Germany as they had full suport."" (should be ""Austria-Hungary had been given a blank check by Germany, as they had full support."").
     - ""France a russian aly began preparing for war due to Russides actions."" (should be ""France, a Russian ally, began preparing for war due to Russia's actions."").
     - ""Arche duke frans ferdinand was assasinated because they wanted to escape Austria's controll and join russia."" (should be ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated because they wanted to escape Austria's control and join Russia."").

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms: ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""Triple Entente",3,3.0,4,True,,,,,22.4162700176239,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 769, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.003845, 'completion_tokens': 800, 'completion_cost': 0.012, 'total_cost': 0.015845}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 838, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.00419, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.004205}"

    - Response does not address the question","Source A:  A British cartoon entitled ‘Betrayed’, published in December 1917. The figure in
the doorway is the German Kaiser.","From Source A, we can see a depiction of a Russian Bolshevik revolutionist with ‘German gold’ trying to maim what looks out to be the tsarist depiction of Russia, and in the background we can see the German Kaiser Wilhelm the second plotting. Contextually we can infer that sential Communist Lenin was sent from Switzerland to Russia where he was exiled to stir up tensions on Russia so that the Germans could get some relief off the Eastern front. The style of clothing that the Russian Imperialist is wearing represents royalty which ties into the fact that Russia had its monarchy killed during the revolution to show its harsh and neglect that it gave to the Russian people centuries prior. Lenin was sent by Kaiser Wilhelm as he knew a time like this for Russia would be perfect as he was brought major famine and poverty to Russia, so he wanted change.
","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the depiction of the Bolshevik with ""German gold"" and the German Kaiser in the background. They also provide some contextual knowledge, mentioning Lenin's return to Russia and the impact of the Bolshevik Revolution. However, the analysis lacks clarity and focus on how these elements are critical of the Bolsheviks. The student does not explicitly explain how the source criticizes the Bolsheviks for betraying Russia during the First World War. 

To reach Level 2, the student would need to provide a more developed analysis, clearly linking the features of the source to the criticism of the Bolsheviks and supporting this with more detailed factual knowledge. For example, they could explain how the Bolsheviks' actions led to Russia's withdrawal from the war, which allowed Germany to concentrate its forces on the Western Front, thus betraying their allies.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B, the picture depicts a array of soldiers - most likely to be on the Allied forces - crossing over no man's land with shells firing over them at a constant rate. Contextually we know that during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the battle of Passchendaele. In 1917, the British forces were able to tactically redirected the way they used artillery by creating a creeping barrage where in a certain order a certain amount of shells could be fired upfront at the troops to clear any enemy ground/territory, which provided as a explosive shield which now able to give them easier access towards the trench for bayonett charging. This was vital to break the stalemate as a historian can gather the fact that the German forces were overwhelmed at the change in fire rate which  was able to will thousand more proving to be more effective. Due to the smoke after the

explosion, the Germans couldn't also see the advancing troops in front of them which caused major distress. Source C brings the idea of tanks into the question which was a revolutionary idea at the time as there was anything like it. In September 1916 the first battalion of tanks were deployed into the Battle of the Somme which allowed for the ease of movement to continue. Trenches had become ineffective for the Germany as they could have just been ran over. Barbed wire which was a massive problem until this point also became ineffective as tanks could have just flattened them causing no distress from when explosives blew them up which only led to them becoming noisy. The tanks had a 360 turret which was later developed which could shoot from anywhere. In the Battle of Cambrai, 1917 they were able to use the tanks for a circular formation in rows as the Battle of the Somme let only 50 tanks remaining from the 400 used. Towards the end of the war which was a vital asset for the allied victory as the Germans could really fight back.

","The student provides a detailed analysis of both sources, showing a good understanding of the content and context. They bring in relevant factual knowledge about the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Passchendaele, and the development of the creeping barrage tactic in Source B. They also discuss the introduction and impact of tanks in Source C, referencing the Battle of Cambrai and the use of tanks in breaking through barbed wire and trenches.

However, the evaluation of the provenance of the sources is somewhat lacking. While the student does mention that Source B is a picture published in a British newspaper and Source C is from a book by a tank commander, they do not fully explore how these aspects of provenance affect the utility of the sources. For example, they could discuss how the publication date of Source B (October 1917) might reflect the public's perception of the war at that time, or how Mitchell's firsthand experience and subsequent publication of his book might provide a reliable account of tank warfare.

The student also does not explicitly evaluate the relationship between the sources, which is a key criterion for Level 4. They do mention that both sources show different aspects of military technology and tactics, but they do not fully explore how these aspects complement or contrast with each other.

  example_answer: []",,"In the 19th Century just after the Franco-Prussian war which was a victory for Prussia, Alfred von Schlieffen created a plan which was fairly simple in a way to take out two of Europe’s biggest powers: France and Russia doing this by gathering a number of 750,000 troops, going through Alsace-Lorraine taking out France before diverting for Russia taking both out in the general scheme, however there was major flaws to this. Number one was that sometime before the war, France had created the Maginot line to protect himself from Germany if they were to ever attack again. This meant Germany had to divert for Belgium. However, in 1839 the Treaty of London was signed with Britain giving full support for Belgium as they gained independence from any country willing to attack them. This meant if Germany diverted for Belgium they would face a double threat with Britain joining the war. The Belgian army too would be employed adding resistance towards the Germans. On the Eastern side, Russia before the war was able to muster up men in the course of 4 weeks which wasn't apart of Germany plan as they assumed Russia would be the attack as a surprise. This led to a war on two fronts. The BEF also came in time to support the invasion before the Germans got to Paris.","The student provides a detailed account of the Schlieffen Plan and its intended execution, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding of the plan's objectives and the historical context. This moves the answer beyond level 1, where only general statements and basic knowledge are required. The answer is structured and shows a simple analysis of causation/consequence, placing it in level 2. 

The student identifies key issues such as the Maginot Line, the Treaty of London, and the rapid mobilization of Russian forces, which disrupted the German plan. These points are supported with factual knowledge, such as the involvement of the BEF and the resistance from Belgium. However, the analysis remains relatively simple and does not fully develop the consequences of these events on the broader context of the war.

To reach level 3, the student would need to provide a more developed analysis, linking the failure of the Schlieffen Plan to the resulting stalemate on the Western Front and the broader implications for the war. This would involve explaining how the diversion through Belgium and the unexpected resistance led to a prolonged conflict and trench warfare.

    - N/A",,"The alliance system in the first World War and the years building up to that was vital for the causes and the actual outcome of the war. I agree with this statement as there were many factors for this argument including: The Brothers alliance, Dual alliance which turned to the Triple alliance and the Entente Cordiale/Entente Alliance. In the late 19th century France and Russia as well as Austria-Hungary and Germany allied to protect themselves from each other in case of a war. The entente cordiale in 1904 was also another reason why tensions fired up with the old Entente and Germany due to the Moroccan crisis. These two events and their conferences started a clear divide in those countries listed as France wanted more colonies however this was disrupting the Kaiser's Weltpolitik which was his world view and the way he wanted to grow his empire doing this by trying to help at Morocco. In the Balkans the tension between the alliances of the Balkan League and the Ottoman empire stirred up causingfor two wars which left that are with nonstop raising tensions. Russia and Serbia had a brotherhood alliance as they were both Slavic. Bosnia another slavic county was going to get annexed by austria (which already had previous tensions with Russia). This angered the Serbains leading the Russians backing them up in justification of a war. The Germans however were not happy with this giving Austria a blank check allowing them for help whenever they need it also giving Russia a ultimatum to stop and back out of Autria-Hungary and Serbian tensions which they desired. 

Another alliance between the French and the Belgians also stopped and aggrovated German plans for WWI in attacking france Belgian led to Britain joining the war which would become a burden for the Kaiser. This caused a massive divide in the Nations of Europe which was a factor of the July crisis which ultimately ended up with the start of world war one. In conclusion we can see that the build up of allinnces between certain countries in Europe and Asia (Japanese and the British) led to a mess as various problems were split through various different nations. This includes Italy who was originally part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria but however to unprecedented events switched to the Entente side by the start of the war.

","The student provides a detailed explanation of the alliance system and its role in causing the First World War. They mention several key alliances, such as the Dual Alliance, Triple Alliance, and Entente Cordiale, and explain how these alliances created tensions and divisions among European powers. The student also discusses specific events, such as the Moroccan Crisis and the Balkan Wars, which further heightened tensions.

The first paragraph demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The student explains the alliances and their impact on international relations, showing a developed line of reasoning. However, the explanation could be more coherent and structured, as the student jumps between different events and alliances without clear transitions.

The second paragraph continues to explain the impact of alliances, particularly focusing on the French-Belgian alliance and its effect on German plans. The student also mentions the July Crisis and the role of alliances in escalating the situation to a full-scale war. This paragraph shows a developed explanation with accurate knowledge, but again, the structure could be improved for better coherence.

The conclusion attempts to summarize the argument, stating that the build-up of alliances led to a complex web of tensions and conflicts. However, the conclusion is somewhat repetitive and lacks a clear, sustained judgement.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a developed explanation of the stated factor (the alliance system) and other factors (specific events and tensions). The student shows accurate knowledge and understanding, but the coherence and logical structure could be improved.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors such as ""aggrovated"" (aggravated), ""allinnces"" (alliances), ""causingfor"" (causing for), ""Serbains"" (Serbians), ""ultimatum"" (ultimatum), and ""Autria"" (Austria).
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some missing commas and periods that could improve readability. For example, ""Bosnia another slavic county"" should be ""Bosnia, another Slavic country,"" and ""Belgian led to Britain joining the war"" should be ""Belgium led to Britain joining the war.""

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall. There are some grammatical errors, such as ""causingfor two wars"" (causing two wars), ""giving Russia a ultimatum"" (giving Russia an ultimatum), and ""led to a mess as various problems were split through various different nations"" (led to a mess as various problems were spread through various nations).
   - Despite these errors, the overall meaning is clear and understandable.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**

This has been used to show the actions of the Bolsheviks in December 1917 and how, encouraged by the kaiser in the doorway, they stole wealth from there own country, and gave it to the Germans. We know in late 1917 Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and lost lots of its land and resources in return for a cease fire in the Eastern Front. The British created the cartoon to show how the Triple Entente had been betrayed by russia and to criticise there actions; Russian withdrawl from the War meant war was only now fought from one front.","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the bearded man tussling with a young woman and the figure of the Kaiser in the doorway.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows a depiction of the Western Front with two types of new technology and tactics being shown. The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. 

Source C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C 
describes how the army constantly made new prototypes 
as the tanks so they could be faster and cause 
more casualties. This meant there was less hand to 
hand fighting because of the tanks physiological and 
devastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C 
is useful to a historian because it has personal 
story from someone actually experiencing the power 
of tanks, showing how the threat they brought. ","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and provides a detailed analysis of their content. For Source B, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and its significance in reducing casualties and improving the effectiveness of assaults. They also mention the role of improved communication, such as the use of radio, in coordinating attacks. This shows a good level of contextual knowledge and links it effectively to the source, making it useful for understanding military technology and tactics during the First World War.

For Source C, the student describes the evolution and impact of tanks, particularly the newer 'Whippet' tanks, during the German Spring Offensive. They highlight the initial unreliability of tanks and their subsequent mass production and strategic use, which contributed to breaking the stalemate on the Western Front. The student also notes the personal perspective of the tank commander, which adds credibility and depth to the source.

However, the evaluation of the provenance of both sources could be more developed. For Source B, the student could discuss the potential bias of a British newspaper during the war and how it might influence the depiction of military tactics. For Source C, while the personal account adds authenticity, the student could consider the potential for bias in a post-war publication and the impact of the author's experiences on his perspective.

Overall, the answer demonstrates developed evaluation of the content of both sources and some consideration of their provenance. To reach the highest level, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of the provenance and explicitly link it to the utility of the sources.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan already had some problems to it, even before it was put into practise. For example it relied on the slow mobilisation of Russia. As the Germans would find out, the Russian army mobilised in just 10 days and had already consigned plans to attack in the East. This meant the Germans would have to fight a war on two fronts, exactly what was trying to be avoided. Furthermore after the death of Alfred Von Schlieffen in 1913, the next general made the army smaller for the assault on France, and also missed Holland from the plan entirely. This meant the Germans would have a weaker force in battle, additioning to them having to divide there army in half to fight in two fronts.

The German plan also relied on Belgium’s invasion which they thought would be quick and easy. However, the Belgian army put up stiff resistance trying forts and its small army, slowing down the German advancement. This gave France and Russia time to communicate and mobilise. Furthermore the German army underestimated the pact Britain had with Belgium in the 1890's, supporting its neutralaty. Therefore when they invaded Belgium and entered through France, The BEF was sent out to stop the Germany army. to May 1914 France and the BEF fought the Germans at the battle of Mons, contributing to stalemate the failure of the Schielfen plan.","The student demonstrates a good understanding of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond basic analysis to a more developed narrative. The answer is structured and well-ordered, with specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The student identifies key problems with the Schlieffen Plan, such as the reliance on the slow mobilisation of Russia, the reduction in the size of the German army, and the omission of Holland from the plan. These points are supported by accurate factual knowledge.

The second paragraph continues to develop the analysis by discussing the resistance of the Belgian army, the impact of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and the resulting stalemate. The student explains how these factors contributed to the failure of the Schlieffen Plan and the subsequent problems in 1914.

To reach Level 4, the answer would need to display more complex analysis, such as linking the different stages of the events and explaining how tension increased or decreased at each stage. The student could also provide more detailed factual knowledge and understanding to support their points.

When Britian Russia and France signed the Triple Entente in retaliation of the Triple Alliance Germany used it to complain that they were being circled in. The Triple entente was used to make Germany back down but could of been a factor for war. Once the two sides were created it was clear War was imminent but Germany and its allies were keen for war then in contrast France and Russia and Britain made a pact us Allience to detterent Germany.

However the assasination os archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbia's black hand Gang also was a jumpstart to war. After the Assassin Austria-Hungery blamed Serbia and had intellignce the Black hand Gang was helped by the Serb government this gave the kaiser a motivation for war due to it alliance with Austria - Hungery. The Austrian government gave Serbia a 10 point deal which they agreed to all but one (letting Austrian soldiers into Serbia). Within a

days War was declared. Russia was dragged in due to its alliance with Serbia and the Germans started there Schlieffen plan in the West turning the Balkans war to a world war.

Finally the Moroccan Crisis was another reason why Germany were happy for a war to start.
France wanted to take over Morocco but Germany also wanted to expand its empire so the kaiser sent a warship into the ports of Morocco to show Germany wanted to be part of World affairs too. The French were outraged and a meeting in Algeciras (Spain) with the USA, Britain, Germany and France calmed the situation down preventing early war. The kaiser did this to see how Sent France could be pushed but Germany was humiliated when Britain Supported France due to there alliance. In 1911 the French were called into Morocco to settle a rebellion but Germany accused France of invading the country. Ultimately it was declared France would take full control of Morocco which humiliated the Kaiser for a Second time. He wanted to prove Germany's strength and it was clear he would not back down a third time, therefor 
when Franz Ferdinand was killed, Germany declared War.","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, and provides a basic explanation of how it contributed to the outbreak of war. They mention the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, and how Germany felt encircled, which is relevant to the question. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge, which is necessary for higher levels.

In the second paragraph, the student discusses the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and its role in triggering the war. They provide some factual details, such as the involvement of the Black Hand Gang and the ultimatum given to Serbia. This explanation is more developed and shows a better understanding of the events, but it still lacks the depth and complexity required for higher levels.

The third paragraph addresses the Moroccan Crisis as another factor contributing to the war. The student provides some factual details about the crisis and its impact on German and French relations. However, the explanation is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear link to the overall question of how it contributed to the tension leading to the war.

Overall, the student demonstrates a basic understanding of the factors leading to the First World War but lacks the depth, detailed knowledge, and complex explanation required for higher levels. The answer falls into Level 2 due to the simple explanations and specific knowledge provided.

### Mark Scheme Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the new selling price:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - Decrease in break-even level of output:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Answer:**
   - The final answer should be 1,500 units.

### Provided Answer:
- The provided answer is:
  \[
  10,000 / 2.5 = 4,000
  \]

### Analysis of Provided Answer:

","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Identification of a way:**
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""they could move location to be closer to competitors."" This satisfies the first marking criterion. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the way:**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the way by adding, ""and attract those customers that would usually go to the competitors."" This explanation is somewhat vague and lacks depth. It does not fully explain how moving closer to competitors would attract customers or why customers would choose the small business over the competitors. The explanation does not clearly link the action to a competitive advantage, which is necessary for full marks in this section.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide a clear cause-and-effect relationship, such as ""charging lower prices"" leading to ""customers are more likely to buy the product because it is cheaper than other products,"" and ""improve the quality of the product"" leading to ""attract customers because they think they are getting a better product."" The candidate's answer lacks this level of clarity and detail.

**Marking Notes:**
- According to the marking notes, answers that list more than one way with no explanation will be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. Although the candidate lists only one way, the explanation provided is insufficiently developed to warrant full marks.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage: ""A small business meeting legal obligations helps as it builds a reputation with the bank."" This satisfies the first marking criterion. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The explanation provided is: ""having a better chance to get a loan for improvements on products."" This explanation is somewhat relevant but not directly aligned with the examples given in the mark scheme. The mark scheme examples focus on avoiding legal consequences, maintaining a positive image, and motivating employees, which are more directly related to meeting legal obligations. However, the candidate's explanation does make a logical connection between meeting legal obligations and building a reputation that could help in securing loans. Given the marking notes that accept any other appropriate response, this explanation can be credited. (1 mark)

Overall, the answer identifies an advantage and provides an explanation, though the explanation is not as strong or directly related to the examples in the mark scheme.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer mentions that a business plan ""sets goals for the year such as make X amount of profit."" This is a valid point as setting profit goals is a form of financial forecasting. However, the answer lacks specific financial tools or information that could be used to forecast success, such as cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis, which are mentioned in the mark scheme's example answers.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**

  - The internet will not provide focused information to let Amelia know if there will be enough demand for her plumbing and building services (AO2).
  - Although she knows how many females live in Birmingham, it would be difficult to find out how many of them own a property or would want a female plumber to work in their homes (AO3a).
  - Lili Heating Ltd will be in competition against other established plumbers. Amelia will need to spend more time developing her target market to make sure there are enough potential customers (AO3a).

Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",The secondary information gathered could be less useful depending on dates this is because it could be out of date research tehrefore usless to her business. Another impact for seconday research on Amelia's business is that it could be not relevant to her business. Therefore she would be using data collected thats not even relevant.,"The candidate identifies two potential impacts of using secondary market research. The first impact is that the information could be outdated, which is stated as ""it could be out of date research therefore useless to her business."" The second impact is that the information might not be relevant to her business, as stated in ""it could be not relevant to her business"" and ""she would be using data collected that's not even relevant.""

However, the response lacks depth and detailed development. The points made are not sufficiently expanded upon to show interconnected reasoning. For example, the candidate does not explain why outdated information would be useless or how irrelevant data could specifically impact Amelia's business decisions. The response also lacks specific contextual references to Amelia's business, such as her unique selling point or the competitive environment in Birmingham.

Given these considerations, the response fits the criteria for Level 1:

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer states, ""she is an entrepreneur who will have to pay taxes on all her money,"" which outlines a reason why the government would want the business to be successful. This point is linked to the idea that the government benefits from tax revenue. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).

Option 1 is a viable option, however her USP is already that she is a woman which would attract women already, showing that she doesn't need to use option 1. In conclusion, while option one is a good idea option 2 is a great one as it provides free advertising for the business and will often attract more people than just giving out a discount.
","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 would be a better choice, providing a reason that social media wouldn't cost any money and would be easier to gain attraction. This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2), but it is limited and lacks depth. The candidate then briefly mentions Option 1, noting that Amelia's unique selling point (USP) as a woman would already attract female customers, suggesting that Option 1 is unnecessary. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but it is quite basic and lacks detailed reasoning.

The conclusion reiterates the preference for Option 2, emphasizing the benefit of free advertising and its potential to attract more customers. However, the justification is simple and does not delve into interconnected points or detailed evaluation.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the business context (AO2). The analysis (AO3a) is basic, with limited connections between points. The judgement (AO3b) is simple and based on limited evaluation.

    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","The most significant in my opinion is to pay less rent (option 1). This would help significantly because there would be more profit that month to spend on other locations. For example, improving products. 
Although option 2 does have some decent benefits, it can also have downsides. For example, some employees may not take in the information provided and more than likely the training will be very basic and the business will have to pay for extended training.

In conclusion, option is the best as it provides the most significant benefits.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 1 (paying less rent) is the most significant. They provide a basic justification by suggesting that this would result in more profit to spend on other locations, such as improving products. This demonstrates a limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts (AO2), placing it in Level 1.

The candidate then briefly considers Option 2, mentioning potential downsides such as employees not absorbing the training information and the need for extended training. This shows an attempt to deconstruct business information but lacks depth and interconnected points, aligning with Level 1 for AO3a.

The conclusion reiterates that Option 1 is the best but does not provide a thorough evaluation or detailed justification, which is required for higher levels. The evaluation (AO3b) is simple and based on limited information, fitting the criteria for Level 1.

Price also helps Ripple because with the money provided by customers, they can upgrade technology and make it even cheaper.","The candidate begins by stating the importance of price for Ripple, noting that it claims to be the best-priced energy-efficient company. This aligns with the context provided, where Ripple claims to supply energy cheaper than its competitors. However, the explanation is quite limited and lacks depth.

In the first paragraph, the candidate mentions that customers would want cheap energy to have more disposable income for other activities like shopping. This is a valid point but is not fully developed or linked back to the business context of Ripple.

The second paragraph briefly touches on how the money provided by customers can help Ripple upgrade technology and make energy even cheaper. This point is relevant but again lacks detailed explanation and connection to the broader business context.

Overall, the response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts but with limited business terminology and application to the specific context of Ripple. The analysis is basic, with limited connections between points, and the evaluation is minimal.

#### Identification of an advantage:
- **Criteria:** Identification of an advantage.
- **Response:** The answer states, ""the person who starts the business and owns it makes any decisions for the business themselves.""
- **Evaluation:** This is not a clear identification of an advantage specific to a private limited company. The mark scheme examples focus on limited liability and the ability to sell shares, which are specific advantages of a private limited company. The candidate's response is more about control, which is not unique to private limited companies.

  - 6",,If a small business meets legal obligations any staff that work there will be happier and more likely to stay as there is laws to help make a working environment safe for staff in a business.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one advantage'. The candidate has suggested an advantage through 'any staff that work there will be happier and more likely to stay'. This is developed through 'as there is laws to help make a working environment safe for staff in a business'. Let's break down the response according to the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage**: The candidate identifies an advantage by stating, ""any staff that work there will be happier and more likely to stay."" This aligns with the example answer, ""Employees will feel that the business is taking good care of them."" Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage**: The candidate explains the advantage by adding, ""as there is laws to help make a working environment safe for staff in a business."" This explanation is somewhat aligned with the example answer, ""Therefore, the business will have a more motivated workforce,"" but it could be more explicitly linked to the business benefits such as increased productivity or reduced turnover. However, it does provide a reasonable explanation of why employees would be happier and more likely to stay. Therefore, this criterion is partially satisfied. (1 mark)

Overall, the candidate's response is clear and focused on the question. The answer identifies an advantage and provides a reasonable explanation, though it could be more explicitly linked to business benefits.

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The answer identifies a disadvantage: ""the employee is likely to leave the business as they aren't being paid on time."" This satisfies the first marking criterion.

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The answer provides some explanation: ""this means that there are less employees in the business making it harder to manage."" This partially explains the consequence of employees leaving, but it lacks depth in terms of the broader impact on the business, such as increased recruitment costs or decreased productivity.

**Comparison with Example Answers:**
- The example answer ""One disadvantage is that the employees will want to leave the business (1). This means the business may have to find new employees (1). This may increase the recruitment costs of the business (1)"" provides a more detailed explanation of the consequences.
- The example answer ""The employees may not be motivated (1). This means the productivity of the employees will fall (1). Therefore, the business may experience problems meeting customer orders (1)"" also provides a detailed chain of reasoning.

This aligns with the indicative content point that adapting existing products may not be as innovative and may not fully meet changing customer needs (AO1b). However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed interconnected points.

The candidate then moves on to discuss the potential benefit, stating that ""adopting an existing product could be better as there is already a product and customer base for you"" and that adapting the product ""to meet customer needs"" could result in ""more people will buy from you as you have improved the product for consumers.""

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""she can show them her financial forecast to make it easier for her to get a loan."" This outlines a way financial information can be used, but it does not directly link to forecasting success. The focus is more on obtaining a loan rather than forecasting the business's success. Therefore, this criterion is partially met but lacks the direct link to forecasting success.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer does link the financial forecast to obtaining a loan, which is a form of linked development. However, the link is not strong enough to fully meet the criteria as it does not directly address how this helps forecast the business's success. The link is more about facilitating loan approval rather than forecasting success. Thus, this criterion is partially met.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - The points are linked to some extent, as the answer connects financial forecasts with obtaining a loan. However, the link is not strong enough to fully satisfy the criteria for 2 marks. Therefore, this criterion is partially met, and the answer should be awarded 1 mark.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme clearly link financial information to forecasting success, such as ensuring enough cash to pay for supplies or setting a target for profit. The given answer does not make such a clear link to forecasting success, focusing instead on obtaining a loan.

- The answer partially meets the criteria but lacks a strong link to forecasting success. Therefore, it should be awarded 1 mark.

  - Using the internet as a source of secondary market research is a fast and convenient way to discover how many females live in Birmingham (AO2).
  - The internet will not provide focused information to let Amelia know if there will be enough demand for her plumbing and building services (AO2).
  - Although she knows how many females live in Birmingham, it would be difficult to find out how many of them own a property or would want a female plumber to work in their homes (AO3a).
  - Lili Heating Ltd will be in competition against other established plumbers. Amelia will need to spend more time developing her target market to make sure there are enough potential customers (AO3a).

Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Because Lili Heating Ltd used the internet for secondary research, the research she has found may not be specific to her business or customer target so she could be using the wrong information. So she could lose money as she hasn't got the correct information for her business.

Also if she uses market research, the information she gathers could be out of date and no longer applied for her business idea. This means that she could be looking at information that doesn't include new businesses in her target market.","The candidate identifies two main impacts of using the internet for secondary market research. The first impact is that the research may not be specific to her business or customer target, which is developed through the idea that she could be using the wrong information and thus lose money. The second impact is that the information gathered could be out of date, which is developed through the idea that it may not include new businesses in her target market.

In terms of application (AO2), the response is somewhat contextualized with references to ""Lili Heating Ltd,"" ""her business,"" and ""customer target."" However, the context is not as detailed or specific as it could be, lacking deeper references to the unique aspects of Amelia's business, such as her being a female plumber or the specific needs of her target market.

For analysis (AO3a), the response provides some logical connections but lacks depth and detailed interconnected points. The reasoning is somewhat simplistic and does not fully explore the implications of using outdated or non-specific information.

Given these observations, the response fits best within Level 2 of the mark scheme. It shows sound application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context, although there are some inconsistencies. The deconstruction of business information and issues finds interconnected points with chains of reasoning, but there are logical inconsistencies and a lack of depth.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer ""convenience"" does not directly state one of the traditional elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, or Price). The traditional elements are clearly defined in the example answers provided in the mark scheme:
     - ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham"" (Place)
     - ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (Promotion)
     - ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (Product)
   - The term ""convenience"" could be interpreted as a benefit or a feature of the service, but it does not directly correspond to one of the four elements of the marketing mix.

### Marking Notes Evaluation

- **To award 1 mark there must be evidence of application.**
  - The answer ""convenience"" does not provide specific evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd. It does not mention how convenience is related to the business context provided, such as the specific services offered, the target market, or the unique selling points.

### Conclusion

Based on the criteria and the marking notes, the answer ""convenience"" does not fulfill the requirement of stating one of the elements of the marketing mix. It also lacks specific application to Lili Heating Ltd.

### Marks Awarded

- **0 marks**: The answer does not meet the criteria of stating one of the elements of the marketing mix and lacks application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer states, ""she is filling a gap in the market so she will make lots of revenue that the government can tax."" This outlines a reason why the government would want the business to be successful, linking the success of the business to increased tax revenue for the government. This satisfies the marking criteria for linked points.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are linked. The candidate connects the idea of filling a market gap to generating revenue, which in turn leads to tax revenue for the government. Therefore, this criterion does not apply as the points are linked.

- **Example answers:**
  - The example answers in the mark scheme include points about the government collecting more tax if the business is successful and taxes being based on profits. The candidate's answer aligns with these examples by mentioning that the government can tax the revenue generated by the business.

- **Award any other valid answer. To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**

Also if she uses social media to advertise it is a lot easier and more accessible for people rather than other methods of advertisement. This means she is more likely to have customers as more people are aware of her business.","The candidate begins by stating that Lili Heating Ltd should choose option B, which is to use social media for advertising. They provide a basic justification by mentioning that online advertising is free and will not affect the business financially. This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2), but it is limited and lacks depth.

The candidate then mentions that social media is easier and more accessible for people, which could lead to more customers being aware of the business. This shows an attempt at analysis (AO3a), but the connections between points are limited and not fully developed.

There is a simple judgement provided, but the justification is minimal and lacks thorough evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",The business is trying to be the cheapest supplier for energy so the quality of the wind turbines could be bad meaning no energy is made.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states: ""the quality of the wind turbines could be bad meaning no energy is made.""
   - This statement identifies a potential risk related to the quality of the wind turbines, which could result in no energy being produced. This is a valid risk for investors because if no energy is produced, the investment would not yield the expected returns.
   - The context supports this risk as it mentions that Ripple is an energy company providing green energy through wind farms. If the wind turbines are of poor quality, it directly impacts the energy production and, consequently, the return on investment for the investors.

### Conclusion:
The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, which is the potential poor quality of wind turbines leading to no energy production. This aligns with the marking criteria and the context provided.

    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  progression:
    - Students can progress to this level by demonstrating thorough and detailed understanding with logically connected reasoning and clear justifications.
  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","Option 2 is better for Ripple as renewable energy methods are fairly new so new employees are less likely to know what they are doing so will struggle to complete their job. So if the Government pays to train them it is easier and cheaper for Ripple to hire new employees.

Also, if the business has trained staff, they won't need to try and hire staff without training meaning they won't break any laws in the employment laws, so they won't be fined, meaning they save money and their reputation as a business.

Also if the government pays for training the business can hire more people as they won't have to pay for training making it easier to manage the business and make it less likely that they are understaffed and can't run the business it could be dangerous.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 is better for Ripple, which is a clear judgement. They provide some reasoning by discussing the novelty of renewable energy methods and the need for training, which is relevant to the context of Ripple. This demonstrates some application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts (AO2), but it is not detailed enough to be considered thorough.

The candidate then mentions the legal implications of hiring untrained staff, which is a valid point, but the explanation is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. This shows an attempt to deconstruct business information and issues (AO3a), but the connections between points are limited and not fully developed.

The final point about the government paying for training allowing the business to hire more people is relevant, but again, the reasoning is not fully fleshed out. The candidate does not provide a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues (AO3b), and the justification is based on limited evaluation.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of business concepts and makes some connections between points, but it lacks the depth and detail required for higher levels. The evaluation is limited and the justification is simple.

Based on the mark scheme, this answer should be placed in Level 1. The candidate shows limited application of knowledge and understanding, attempts to deconstruct business information with limited connections, and makes a simple judgement with limited evaluation.

They mention that price is important because Ripple aims to be the cheapest supplier of renewable energy and needs to charge a fair price to cover the costs of running and maintaining wind turbines. However, this response does not provide a detailed analysis or evaluation of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix.

**Level and Mark Assignment:**

1. **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b):**
   - The candidate demonstrates a basic understanding of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix but does not use much business terminology.
   - This aligns with Level 1 criteria: ""Demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with limited business terminology used.""

2. **Application (AO2):**
   - The application of knowledge to the business context is minimal. The candidate mentions the cost of running and maintaining wind turbines but does not elaborate on how this impacts Ripple's pricing strategy or its competitive position.
   - This aligns with Level 1 criteria: ""Limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context.""

3. **Analysis (AO3a):**
   - The response attempts to deconstruct the issue of pricing but does so in a very limited way. There are no interconnected points or chains of reasoning.
   - This aligns with Level 1 criteria: ""Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points.""

4. **Evaluation (AO3b):**
   - The candidate makes a simple judgement that price is important but does not provide a thorough justification or evaluation of business information and issues.
   - This aligns with Level 1 criteria: ""Makes a judgement, providing a simple justification based on limited evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made.""

**Overall Level:**
- The response fits best within Level 1 due to its limited depth and scope.

**Mark Awarded:**
- Given the minimal content and limited evaluation, the response is at the lower end of Level 1.

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   \[
   \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[

The candidate's response needs to identify an advantage and then explain it. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage**: The candidate states, ""Customers would be more persuaded to go to a place which has legal obligations and legal properties."" This suggests that meeting legal obligations can attract customers, which can be considered an advantage. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage**: The candidate does not provide a clear explanation of why customers would be more persuaded to go to a place that meets legal obligations. The response lacks further development or reasoning, such as how meeting legal obligations can build trust or ensure safety, which would make customers more inclined to visit.

  - The candidate states, ""can look bad on employment cases,"" which can be interpreted as a disadvantage. However, this is not clearly articulated as a specific disadvantage related to the business operations or employee behavior. The second part, ""customers would want to shop where employees get paid,"" is more relevant but still lacks clarity. The identification is somewhat vague and not directly aligned with the example answers provided in the mark scheme.
  - **Partial fulfillment**: The disadvantage is not clearly identified in a manner that aligns with the mark scheme examples.

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate does not provide a clear explanation of how the identified disadvantage impacts the business. The statement ""can look bad on employment cases"" is not expanded upon to explain the consequences for the business. Similarly, ""customers would want to shop where employees get paid"" is not developed to explain the impact on the business, such as loss of customers or damage to reputation.
  - **Does not fulfill**: The explanation is lacking in detail and does not provide a clear link to the business's potential issues, such as increased recruitment costs or decreased productivity.

#### Explanation of the Advantage
- **Criteria**: Explaining the advantage.

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria and the context provided.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success.**
  - The answer does not outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. It mentions ""better equipment and more workers,"" but this is not directly related to how financial information can forecast success. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks.**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The response does not provide any development or explanation of how ""better equipment and more workers"" relate to financial information in a business plan or how they help forecast success. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark.**
  - Since the points are not linked and there is no development, the response can only be considered for a maximum of 1 mark. However, even for 1 mark, the answer should at least mention some aspect of financial information, which it does not.

**Example Answers:**

- The example answers provided in the mark scheme clearly link financial information to forecasting success, such as mentioning a cash-flow forecast or a break-even forecast. The given answer does not align with these examples.

**Marking Notes:**

- To award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. The answer does not meet this requirement.
- The answer does not provide any valid points related to financial information or its role in forecasting success.

**Conclusion:**

The answer ""Better equipment and more workers"" does not satisfy any of the marking criteria. It does not mention financial information or how it could help forecast success, nor does it provide linked points or development.

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
