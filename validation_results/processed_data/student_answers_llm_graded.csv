how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.

B and C are very useful to

soldiers advancing under an artillery 
barrage. This was called the creeping 
barrage. The creeping barrage was used
to destroy anything infront of 
the soldiers then they would 
all follow in clearing up the 
rest including the tanks going in.
Source C is also useful as it 
shows how big of a difference tanks 
made in war as they could 
quickly destroy through German 
soldiers and smash through anything 
in its path.","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides a basic analysis of their content. For Source B, the student mentions the ""creeping barrage"" tactic and explains its purpose. For Source C, the student highlights the effectiveness of tanks, specifically the ""Whippets,"" in combat. However, the analysis lacks depth and detailed contextual knowledge. The student does not evaluate the provenance of the sources or provide extended reasoning related to their utility.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to include more specific factual knowledge, such as the development and impact of the creeping barrage tactic and the role of tanks in the First World War.

The student also mentions the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand as another main cause of the First World War. This is relevant and shows an understanding of another factor, but again, the explanation is brief and lacks detailed factual knowledge.

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""goverment"" should be ""government.""
     - ""Britains'"" should be ""Britain's.""
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some issues:
     - The comma after ""France"" in the first sentence is unnecessary.
     - The sentence ""this made Germany very wary of what it did."" should start with a capital letter.
     - The sentence ""this also built tension as many people thought it was the German goverment behind it."" should start with a capital letter.
     - The sentence ""this is the idea of the Triple Entente."" should start with a capital letter.
     - The sentence ""they Britain and France both promised to attack if Germany tried to invade Belgium and try to keep them out."" is awkwardly phrased and could be clearer.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some issues:
     - ""built made tensions high"" is awkward and should be ""built up tensions"" or ""made tensions high.""
     - ""they Britain and France both promised"" should be ""Britain and France both promised.""
     - ""Britains' France's or Russia's allies or colonies"" should be ""Britain's, France's, or Russia's allies or colonies.""

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately:
     - ""Triple Entente""
     - ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand""
     - ""Alliance System""
   - These terms are used correctly and enhance the response.

### Conclusion:
- The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though there are a few errors.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, though some sentences could be clearer.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

### Final Assessment:
Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student’s response fits best in **Level 2**. The errors present do not significantly hinder the overall meaning, and the use of specialist terms is good.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B, we can see an image displaying the tradectory of artillery bombardments. The allies use the cover created by the smoke and explosions to advance through no-mans land with the element of surprise. This allowed it so that the enemy would have a difficult time discerning where the enemy were attacking from. This form of tactical manouvering is known as a 'creeping barrage'. The allies would time artillery bombardment at certain angles and simultaneously the soldiers would 'creep in'.

Tanks were first introduced in the battle of the Somme 1916, but were largely inneffective as they were slow (only reaching speeds of 4 mph), many tactics were

not developed for them as the British thought of not much use for them. But by 1917 and 1918, tanks were being deployed in large rows of 200-300 tanks which would cross over no-mans land and destroy the barbed wire defences. In source C, we see the mention of machine guns on the tanks as they were added as a way to bring more firepower. These machine guns were mounted on and could turn 360 degrees to inflict damage upon the enemies.","The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the content of both sources. In Source B, they describe the use of artillery bombardments and the tactic of a 'creeping barrage,' explaining how it provided cover for soldiers advancing through no-man's land. This shows a simple evaluation of the content of the source, which is a level 2 indicator. However, the student does not evaluate the provenance of Source B, which is necessary for a higher level.

In Source C, the student describes the use of tanks, specifically the 'Whippets,' and their effectiveness in battle. They mention the introduction of machine guns on tanks and their tactical use. This again shows a simple evaluation of the content, which is a level 2 indicator. However, the student does not evaluate the provenance of Source C, which is necessary for a higher level.

To reach level 3, the student would need to provide extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources, including an evaluation of both the content and provenance. For example, they could discuss how Source B, being a picture published in a British newspaper in 1917, might have been intended to boost public morale by showing the effectiveness of British tactics. For Source C, they could discuss how the account of a tank commander who was awarded a medal for bravery provides a first-hand perspective on the use of tanks in the war, adding credibility to the source.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was heavily reliant on Russia taking a long time to mobilize and a very quick and decisive win against France (in 40 days). The plan was to have a large bulk of the German army invade France by cutting into Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to surprise the French, who would be anticipating an attack directly into France on the boarder between them. However, the Schlieffen plan failed as Russia only took 10 days to mobilize (faster than expected) and Belgium put up a fierce and resistance fight against the Germans (much more resistance than Germany had anticipated). Ultimately, invading through Belgium only helped the stalemate last longer as Britain was forced to join the war effort as invading Belgium initiated an 1843 treaty of London where Britain vowed to protect Belgium. This prolonged the war significantly, turning 40 days into 4 years.
","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer identifies key elements of the plan, such as the reliance on Russia's slow mobilization and the quick defeat of France, and explains how these expectations were not met. The student mentions the unexpected speed of Russia's mobilization and the strong resistance from Belgium, which are accurate and relevant points.

The answer also highlights the involvement of Britain due to the Treaty of London, which is a significant consequence of the Schlieffen Plan's failure. This shows an understanding of how the plan's failure led to a prolonged war, turning a planned 40-day campaign into a four-year conflict.

However, the analysis could be further developed to reach a higher level. For example, the student could explain how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to the stalemate and trench warfare on the Western Front, providing more detailed reasoning and sequencing of events.

The alliances were the main trigger for many of the events, wars and crises that led up to world war one. The black hand (a terrorist group) assasinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the heir to the austrian-hungarian throne) leaving only serbia to blame for the assasination. Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany. Then Germany invaded Belgium bringing Britain into the war as it triggered the 1843 treaty of London which Britain vowed to protect Belgium from invading forces. Because of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's death,Europe was involved in an all-out war.

In 1871, shortly after Germany's unification, Germany and Austria-Hungary made an alliance together as they both shared similar cuteral identities,had shared the same common language of German and were politically close to each other. Later, the Italians joined the dual alliance to form the triple alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. In 1892, France and Russia formed an alliance together. This was a threat towards Germany as it meant they could be attacked from either the East or the West. Later in 1904, Britain formed an alliance with France, known as the Entente Cordiale (Friendly alliance). Then in 1906, Britain, France and Russia all came together to form the triple Entente. The alliance system made political disputes more intense as one disagreement could lead to a major war. This is clearly seen in the Moroccan crisises and the Balkan wars. The involvement of this many countries made it impossible to avoid an all  out war from breaking out in Europe, thus causing the start of World War One.","The student begins by addressing the given factor, the Alliance System, and explains how it divided Europe into two camps. They provide a detailed account of the events following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, showing how the alliances led to a chain reaction of war declarations. This demonstrates a good understanding of the immediate causes of World War I and the role of the alliances, supported by specific factual knowledge.

In the second paragraph, the student provides a historical context for the alliances, explaining the formation of the Dual Alliance, Triple Alliance, and Triple Entente. They explain how these alliances created a tense political environment where disputes could escalate into major conflicts, referencing the Moroccan crises and Balkan wars as examples. This shows a developed explanation of the stated factor and its impact on European tensions.

However, the answer could be improved by addressing other factors that contributed to the outbreak of World War I, such as militarism, imperialism, and nationalism. The student should also attempt to make a sustained judgement by comparing the importance of the Alliance System with these other factors.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding of the Alliance System and its role in causing World War I. The explanation is developed and coherent, but the answer would benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of other contributing factors and a clearer sustained judgement.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors such as ""assasinated"" (should be ""assassinated""), ""austrian-hungarian"" (should be ""Austro-Hungarian""), ""cuteral"" (should be ""cultural""), and ""crisises"" (should be ""crises"").
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some missing commas and periods that could improve readability. For example, ""Europe was divided in two different camps"" could use a comma after ""camps."" Additionally, ""austrian-hungarian throne) leaving only serbia to blame"" should have a comma after ""throne).""
   - Despite these errors, the overall meaning is not significantly hindered.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall. There are some minor grammatical issues, such as ""Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany"" which could be more clearly written as ""Germany declared war on Russia, and France declared war on Germany.""
   - The sentence structure is mostly correct, but some sentences are long and could be broken down for better clarity. For example, ""Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force)"" could be split into two sentences for better readability.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""alliance system,"" ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Austro-Hungarian throne,"" ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""triple Entente,"" ""Moroccan crises,"" and ""Balkan wars.""
   - These terms are used appropriately and demonstrate a good understanding of the historical context.

**Conclusion:**
- The student demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, though there are a few errors.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning, and the errors present do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student’s answer fits well within Level 2. The errors present are not severe enough to drop the answer to Level 3, and the use of specialist terms and overall control of meaning justify awarding 3 marks.",3,3,4,True,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,7.10531210899353,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 913, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.004565, 'completion_tokens': 517, 'completion_cost': 0.007755, 'total_cost': 0.01232}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 555, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.002775, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.00279}"

The candidate's response needs to identify an advantage and then explain it. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate states, ""One advantage of starting a business as a private limited company is that the business will have money."" This is a vague identification of an advantage. The mark scheme expects a more specific advantage such as ""limited liability"" or ""ability to sell shares to raise finance."" Therefore, this part of the answer does not fully satisfy the criteria.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The candidate continues with ""and will not be able to struggle and may already have customers."" This explanation is unclear and does not logically follow from the initial statement. The mark scheme expects a clear explanation such as ""This means that any debts are the responsibility of the business"" or ""This is good because the business may have extra funds for investment."" The candidate's explanation does not meet the criteria as it lacks clarity and relevance.

### Example Answers Comparison:
- The example answers provide clear and specific advantages such as ""limited liability"" and ""ability to sell shares to raise finance,"" followed by logical explanations. The candidate's answer lacks this specificity and logical development.

### Conclusion:
- **Identification of an advantage:** 0 marks (The advantage identified is too vague and not specific to a private limited company).
- **Explanation of the identified advantage:** 0 marks (The explanation is unclear and does not logically follow from the identified advantage).

### Total Marks Awarded:

The internet would also help a business to choose location depending on an area where sales are high.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one way'. The candidate's response should be evaluated against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate mentions, ""The internet may rate it based on its location if it’s in a bad area it will be rated badly."" This does not clearly identify a way the internet affects where a small business chooses to locate. The statement is vague and does not directly address the impact of the internet on location choice.
  - The candidate also states, ""The internet would also help a business to choose location depending on an area where sales are high."" This is closer to identifying a way but is still not specific enough to be awarded the mark.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain by saying, ""if it’s in a bad area it will be rated badly"" and ""if it’s in a good area it may will be rated good."" However, this explanation is not clear and does not provide a coherent rationale for how the internet affects location choice.
  - The statement, ""The internet would also help a business to choose location depending on an area where sales are high,"" suggests that the internet can provide data on sales performance in different areas, but this explanation is not fully developed or clearly linked to the initial identification.

**Example Answers for Reference:**
- ""The business could choose a cheaper location (1)""
- ""This is because the business can use e-commerce (1)""
- ""As a result, the business may not require a physical retail location (1)""
- ""The business will need to be in a location with good internet connections (1)""
- ""This is because a business may need the internet to communicate with stakeholders (1)""
- ""A location with a weak signal could cause barriers to communication for the business (1)""

**Evaluation:**
- The candidate's response does not clearly identify a specific way the internet affects location choice. The statements provided are vague and do not align well with the example answers.
- The explanation provided is not coherent or fully developed, making it difficult to award marks for explanation.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B it shows the British Soilders advancing under an artillery barrage. The british Soilder were running in waves all in different waves. this is because they cannot be in any artillery barage. you can see that all the soilders are running and still alive and not getting under an artillery barage. Each wave protects you from a plane and from bombs dropping on you.

In Source C it Shows that the german Soilder were preparing an attack on the british tank, but then 7 of the newest and fastest tanks named whippets came and drove straight into the german Soilders and scattered them in all directions, which this had destroyed the German threat. This helps the students studying military technology understand about how fast and powerful the Whippet was. In source B shows how useful and how good the strategy was used by the british soldiers were they could run across the battlefield without dying this helps the student studying Military technology.

","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student notes that British soldiers are advancing under an artillery barrage and explains the tactic of running in waves to avoid being hit by artillery. For Source C, the student describes how the new Whippet tanks scattered German soldiers and eliminated the threat, highlighting the effectiveness of this new technology.

However, the analysis lacks depth and detailed contextual knowledge. The student does not provide extended reasoning or evaluate the provenance of the sources, which is necessary for higher levels. The explanation of how these sources are useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War is also quite simplistic and not fully developed.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to include more specific factual knowledge, such as the development and impact of the creeping barrage tactic in Source B and the significance of the Whippet tanks in Source C. Additionally, the student should evaluate the provenance of the sources, considering the reliability and perspective of a British newspaper during the war and a post-war account by a tank commander.

### Mark Scheme Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - Break-even formula: Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Variable Costs)
   - Calculation: £10,000 ÷ (£6.50 – £2.50) = 2,500 units
   - Decrease: 4,000 units (original break-even) - 2,500 units (new break-even) = 1,500 units
   - Marks: 1 mark for correct substitution and calculation, 1 mark for correct final answer.

### Provided Answer Analysis:
1. **Step-by-Step Review:**
   - £10,000 / 250 = 400
     - This calculation is incorrect. The correct formula should be £10,000 ÷ (£6.50 – £2.50).
   - 6.50 * 4000 = 26000
     - This calculation is irrelevant to finding the break-even point.
   - 5.00 * 4000 = 20000
     - This calculation is also irrelevant to finding the break-even point.
   - 2000 units
     - This final answer is incorrect and does not follow from the correct method.

### Grading:
- **Correct Working:**
  - The provided answer does not show the correct substitution into the break-even formula.
  - No correct intermediate steps are shown that align with the mark scheme.
- **Final Answer:**
  - The final answer of 2000 units is incorrect.

#### Explanation of the way:
- **Criteria:** Explanation of the way a small business could become more competitive.
- **Evaluation:** The explanation provided is unclear and lacks depth. The candidate mentions that identifying products with increasing sales ""could lead to an increase in profit,"" but does not explain how this would make the business more competitive.

The candidate has suggested an advantage through ""this could make people want to work for a business by following a legal obligation like employee's wage or discrimination."" However, the explanation is not fully developed. Let's break down the response according to the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage**: The candidate identifies an advantage by stating, ""this could make people want to work for a business by following a legal obligation like employee's wage or discrimination."" This aligns with the example answer, ""Employees will feel that the business is taking good care of them."" Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage**: The candidate does not fully explain how meeting legal obligations leads to the advantage. The statement ""or even paying them on time"" is an attempt to explain but lacks depth. The explanation should connect the advantage to a broader outcome, such as increased motivation or productivity. The example answers provide a more developed explanation, such as ""Therefore, the business will have a more motivated workforce"" and ""This could lead to an increase in productivity."" The candidate's response does not reach this level of detail. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied. (0 marks)

Overall, the candidate has identified an advantage but has not sufficiently explained it.

#### Identification of an Advantage
- **Criteria:** Identification of an advantage.
- **Evaluation:** The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""By a business using retained profit as a source of finance it gain profit it makes them instead of having to pay the money back and borrowing it.""
- **Mark Scheme Reference:** The mark scheme example ""Interest is not paid on retained profit"" aligns with the candidate's point about not having to pay the money back.
- **Conclusion:** This criterion is satisfied.
- **Marks Awarded:** 1 mark.

#### Explanation of the Advantage
- **Criteria:** Explaining the advantage.
- **Evaluation:** The explanation is somewhat unclear and lacks depth. The candidate states, ""instead of having to pay the money back and borrowing it,"" which implies that retained profit avoids the need for borrowing and thus avoids interest payments. However, the explanation is not fully developed or clearly articulated.
- **Mark Scheme Reference:** The mark scheme expects a clear explanation, such as ""The business would not experience an increase in costs"" or ""Retained profit does not dilute the ownership of the business.""
- **Conclusion:** The explanation is partially there but not fully developed.

Instead, it discusses the unique selling point (USP) and word-of-mouth recommendations, which are not directly related to financial information. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked to financial information. The response mentions ""having a unique selling point (usp)"" and ""her business could be recommended by this people who offer her services and are satisfied by it,"" but these points are not connected to how financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked and do not address financial information, the answer does not meet the criteria for even 1 mark. The response is off-topic and does not address the question about financial information in a business plan.

This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence. This was to see how far France would push. And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support.

Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state.","**Marks Awarded: 2**

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""Morrocan"" should be ""Moroccan.""
     - ""Morroco"" should be ""Morocco.""
     - ""britian"" should be ""Britain.""
     - ""rebillion"" should be ""rebellion.""
     - ""tukey"" should be ""Turkey.""
   - Punctuation is generally correct, but there are some issues:
     - The sentence ""This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence."" is a run-on sentence and could be broken down for clarity.
     - The sentence ""This was to see how far France would push."" could be better integrated into the previous sentence for coherence.
     - The sentence ""And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support."" starts with ""And,"" which is generally discouraged in formal writing.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student demonstrates a general control of grammar, but there are some issues:
     - The phrase ""which this had France wanted to take over Morroco"" is awkward and unclear.
     - The phrase ""Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence"" could be clearer if rephrased.
     - The sentence ""And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support."" could be rephrased for clarity and grammatical correctness.
     - The phrase ""when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state"" lacks clarity and proper grammatical structure.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses some specialist terms such as ""Moroccan crisis,"" ""kaiser,"" and ""allies,"" but the range is not particularly wide.
   - The explanation of the events is somewhat accurate but lacks depth and detail that would demonstrate a wide range of specialist terms.

**Conclusion:**
- The student's response demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, though there are notable errors.
- The student shows general control of grammar, but there are several areas where clarity and correctness could be improved.
- The use of specialist terms is good but not extensive.

Given the criteria, the student's response fits best within **Level 2**. The errors present prevent it from reaching Level 1, but the overall control of meaning and reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation justify awarding **2 marks**.",0,2,4,False,0.375,0.0,0.0,,,,,11.917859077453613,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 616, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.00308, 'completion_tokens': 568, 'completion_cost': 0.00852, 'total_cost': 0.0116}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 606, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.00303, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.003045}"

  - The challenge of setting up a plumbing business in Birmingham, where competition is high, could be a driving force for Amelia (AO2).
  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).
  - As a result, she would be determined to succeed as there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. This could give her an extra incentive to do well. (AO3a).
  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

### Marking Criteria:
1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The Answer provided is: ""What work needs to be done and how it needs to be done to a high standard.""
   - The marketing mix consists of the 4 Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. The question specifically asks for an element other than price.
   - The Answer seems to be referring to the quality of the service provided, which can be interpreted as part of the ""Product"" element of the marketing mix. However, it is not explicitly clear or directly stated as such.
   - The Mark Scheme example for ""Product"" is: ""Product is to repair/install boilers."" This example is clear and directly states the product.
   - The Answer does not clearly state ""Product"" or any other element of the marketing mix explicitly. It is more focused on the quality and standard of work, which is an aspect of the product but not clearly articulated as such.

### Conclusion:
- The Answer does not explicitly state one element of the marketing mix. It implies an aspect of the ""Product"" element but does not clearly articulate it in the context of the marketing mix.
- According to the Mark Scheme, to award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application. The Answer does not meet this criterion clearly and explicitly.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer does not provide linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. The response focuses on the perspective of female customers rather than the government's interest. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The response does not link the points to the government's interest. It states, ""Because many female customers feel that they can relate more easily with doing repairs in their house,"" which is not directly related to why the government would want the business to be successful. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme focus on the government's interest, such as tax collection and employment. The given answer does not align with these examples as it does not mention any government-related benefits.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",I think Lili heating LTD should consider option 1 which is offer a discounted price to female customers. This is because if a woman gets a discount this could be forwarded to other women which is another way of promoting a business by people sharing it and telling friends and family. This could help towards promoting a business. Overall this will lead to an increase in profit and having an increase in profit for Lili heating LTD is good as she has just started and will not need to struggle of survival. And option 2 that doesn't help as much as option 1 towards business growth.,"The candidate begins by stating that Lili Heating Ltd should choose Option 1, which is to offer a discounted price to female customers. This is followed by a justification that focuses on the potential for word-of-mouth promotion, which is a valid point and demonstrates some understanding of business concepts (AO2). However, the application of knowledge is limited and lacks depth, as it does not fully explore the implications or potential drawbacks of this option.

The analysis (AO3a) is basic and lacks interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The candidate mentions that offering discounts could lead to increased promotion and profit, but does not provide a detailed explanation or consider other factors that might influence this outcome. The reasoning is somewhat superficial and does not fully deconstruct the business information or issues.

The evaluation (AO3b) is present but limited. The candidate makes a simple judgement that Option 1 is better for business growth compared to Option 2, but the justification is not thorough. The conclusion is brief and does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding, basic analysis with limited connections between points, and a simple judgement with minimal justification.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",This can make one person own a share in a lot depending on how much. So a person can own more of a share. And they can lose out on more and can go bankrupt as they are a small business.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria and the context provided.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""And they can lose out on more and can go bankrupt as they are a small business.""
   - This statement identifies a potential risk for investors, which is the possibility of losing their investment and going bankrupt. This aligns with the marking criteria of stating a risk for investors.
   - The context mentions that Ripple is a consumer-owned wind farm, and the risk of losing money is a valid concern for investors in such ventures.

### Example Answers Comparison:
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme include:
  - ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" (1)
  - ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs"" (1)
  - ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy"" (1)

The given answer aligns most closely with the first example answer, ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm,"" as it mentions the risk of losing out on more and potentially going bankrupt.

### Marking Notes:
- The marking notes specify that to award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application.
- The answer does apply the context of Ripple being a small business and the risk of financial loss, which is relevant to the context provided.

### Conclusion:
The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, which is the potential financial loss and bankruptcy. This satisfies the marking criteria and aligns with the example answers provided in the mark scheme.

This will be favorited by people. People will recommend this business and people will use their services.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer does mention a benefit to customers by stating, ""This will create a green energy plan to establish how much a customer should invest into Ripple."" This aligns with the marking criteria as it identifies a benefit related to the creation of a green energy plan tailored to customer needs. Therefore, this part of the answer satisfies the marking criteria.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer attempts to provide linked development by stating, ""This will be favorited by people. People will recommend this business and people will use their services."" However, this development is not directly linked to the benefit to customers but rather to the business itself. The focus should be on how the benefit impacts the customers directly, such as ensuring they receive the correct amount of energy for their needs or getting the best return on their investment. The provided development does not sufficiently link back to the benefit to customers, thus failing to meet this criterion.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - Since the points are not effectively linked to the benefit to customers, the answer can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

**Total Marks Awarded: 1**

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",this will help the business from not being able to struggle if the price is right ig its a good price people will recommend it to other people and this will help the business growth by telling family and friends can help to lead into an increase in profit.,"The candidate's response is very limited and lacks depth.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B, the picture shows a section Of British soldiers advencing under artilery bourrage. The picture was published in a British newspaper and and could be an awareness to show the changes of technology to the citizens of great Britain. In this case, the changes in technology could be the artillery due to its raw increase accuracy and fire rate. Another charge in technology was fighter planes. The way that the fighter get could damage people and find them was due to a savee secret compartment where they could throw bombs out of it creating the havoc among the soilders on the groud. Some planes had a camera attached to the plane so it could take a birds eye view picture to find and locate the exact co-ordinates to attack them. However, In Source C It tells the reader about a tank operator called Frank Mitchell who is writing about his experiences in the spring offensive in 1918. He was describing his experiences using tanks and how powerful they could be. They quickly destroyed German trench. Shows how this new machine could stop anything in its track and even was a defense mechanism to stop the new machine guns.

To an Historian these & other sources are both useful in there own use. Source B describes the way artillery barrage had become worse and more accurate to the enemy soldiers. Source C also shows the way new technology such as tanks can help the opposition win the war.","The student begins by describing the content of Source B, noting that it shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage. They suggest that the picture, published in a British newspaper, could be intended to raise awareness among British citizens about technological advancements, specifically in artillery. The student also mentions fighter planes and their capabilities, although this is not directly related to Source B, which focuses on artillery.

In the second paragraph, the student discusses Source C, which is an account by Frank Mitchell, a tank commander, describing the effectiveness of tanks during the German Spring Offensive in 1918. The student highlights how the new 'Whippet' tanks were able to quickly destroy German threats, showcasing the power and utility of tanks in warfare.

The student attempts to evaluate the usefulness of both sources to a historian, noting that Source B illustrates the increased accuracy and fire rate of artillery, while Source C demonstrates the effectiveness of tanks in combat. However, the evaluation lacks depth and specific contextual knowledge that would strengthen the analysis.

To improve, the student should provide more detailed evaluation of the provenance of both sources, explaining how the context in which they were produced affects their reliability and usefulness. Additionally, the student should integrate more specific factual knowledge about the technological and tactical developments during the First World War to support their analysis.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 2 due to the simple evaluation of the content and some attempt to address the provenance. To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide extended reasoning related to utility and more detailed contextual knowledge.

The main two alliances were the triple alliance which involved Germany Austria-Hungary, and Italy and the 'triple Entente' consisted of Russia, France and Britain. The morrocon Crisis could also include the alliances because it forced Britain to get involved when Germany decided to ignore there heed of war. The collapse of the Ottoman empire could also be a cause of the main cause. because Austria Hungary attacked Serbia it got Russia involved and then got Germany involved due to their alliance.

The way Germany handed a 'blank cheque' over to Austria-Hungary could also have started the argument or the main cause due to it presenting almost a brotherhood to both countries making them a powerful combination.

In my opinion, the alliances is a massive factor of the first World war and It is in fact the main cause, however it also shows how both alliances divided to fight against each other and how the other countries composed of loyalty but also betrayal. ","The student begins by acknowledging the Alliance System as a cause of the First World War but also mentions other potential causes. However, the introduction lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to follow the argument.

In the second paragraph, the student lists the main alliances and briefly mentions the Moroccan Crisis and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. While these points are relevant, they are not developed or explained in detail. The student does not provide specific knowledge or understanding of how these events contributed to the war, which limits the answer to a basic explanation.

The third paragraph mentions Germany's ""blank cheque"" to Austria-Hungary but again lacks detailed explanation or analysis. The student does not explain the significance of this event or how it contributed to the escalation of the conflict.

The conclusion reiterates the student's opinion that the Alliance System was a significant factor but does not provide a sustained judgement or complex explanation. The answer lacks coherence, logical structure, and detailed factual knowledge, which are necessary for higher levels.

However, there were several other parts that could also be called the ""main cause."" These parts can could conform of Keiser Wilhehms thirst for power and global domination to the morocco crisis between France and Germany.

The main two alliances were the triple alliance which involved Germany Austria-Hungary, and Italy and the 'triple Entente' consisted of Russia, France and Britain. The morrocon Crisis could also include the alliances because it forced Britain to get involved when Germany decided to ignore there heed of war. The collapse of the Ottoman empire could also be a cause of the main cause. because Austria Hungary attacked Serbia it got Russia involved and then got Germany involved due to their alliance.

The way Germany handed a 'blank cheque' over to Austria-Hungary could also have started the argument or the main cause due to it presenting almost a brotherhood to both countries making them a powerful combination.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows a attacking technique known as the creeping barrage. Source C is a account from a veteran who fought in spring offensive. These sources are useful for a historian. Source C talks about whippets a new tank. In 1916, when tanks were first used they struggled to break enemy lines. Within 2 years they were able to move quickly into enemy lines. I believe the usage of tanks in the spring offensive was a key reason germany specialised unit, storm troopers, even after artillery fire and mustard gas.

Source B is a propaganda news article showing a new attack the creeping barrage. It was used in Verdun to break the stalemate by providing covers for soldiers. It demonstrates how accurate artillery fire had become and how well timed the army had become. However due to it being British propaganda it hides the issues from the public. For example if any of the timing were of by even a second it could lead to men dieng by there own artillery this happened and hundreds died. Both sources are usefull but they hide the issues with new technology because of the government controll over media in war. ","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some contextual knowledge to support their analysis. For Source B, they mention the ""creeping barrage"" and explain its purpose in breaking the stalemate at Verdun. They also acknowledge the source's nature as propaganda, which adds a layer of evaluation regarding its reliability. For Source C, they discuss the introduction of the ""Whippet"" tanks and their effectiveness during the Spring Offensive, providing some historical context about the development of tank technology.

However, the evaluation of the provenance is not fully developed. While the student mentions that Source B is propaganda, they do not fully explore how this affects its utility. Similarly, for Source C, they note that it is an account from a veteran but do not delve into how this firsthand perspective might influence its reliability or usefulness.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed evaluation of the provenance of both sources and consistently link this to their utility. They should also aim to integrate more specific factual knowledge to support their points.

Overall, the answer falls into level 2 due to the simple evaluation of content and some contextual knowledge. To achieve level 3, the student would need to extend their reasoning related to utility and provide a more thorough evaluation of the provenance.

The first issue this caused was a war on two front west France, east Russia. This meant that Germany was spread thin on supply meaning the soldiers began to starve as they couldn't transport food to 2 fronts. For survival the Germans began to dig trenches so the British and the French did too.

This was the second issue the creation of trenches led to a stalemate. During this thousands of men died but no land was taken due to periods of heavy artillery fire. In addition the trenches condition caused issues as disease spread fast so hundreds died due to a lack of hygiene for example trench foot from the muddy floor and cholera was spread due to flees bitting the infected and spreading it.","The student begins by identifying the Schlieffen Plan and its intended purpose, which is a good start. They mention the failure of the plan due to Belgian resistance and Russia's rapid mobilization, which is accurate and relevant to the question. This moves the answer beyond Level 1, as it shows specific knowledge and understanding.

In the second paragraph, the student explains the consequence of the plan's failure, which led to a war on two fronts. They mention the logistical issues faced by Germany, such as the difficulty in transporting supplies, which is a valid point. This demonstrates a simple analysis of causation/consequence, placing the answer in Level 2.

The third paragraph discusses the creation of trenches and the resulting stalemate, which is another consequence of the Schlieffen Plan's failure. The student provides specific details about the conditions in the trenches, such as disease and trench foot, which adds depth to their answer. This shows a developed analysis of causation/consequence, moving the answer towards Level 3.

However, to reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex analysis, including detailed sequencing and reasoning. They should explain how each part of the sequence increased tension and led to a crisis. For example, they could discuss how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to the prolonged nature of World War I and its broader implications.

For example, countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England began to worry and they began forming alliances with the entene cordial in 1904 with France and England and the triple extent in 1906 with France England and Russia. This ment if any country went to war they would all get dragged in.

The alliances also escalated the balkans crisis into major war as Austria Hungary had been given a blanc check by Germany as they had full suport. It also created tension between Russia (not wanting to look weak) and Germany. Due to Russias pride they refused to step down to Germany. France a russian aly began preparing for war due to Russides actions. Austria would use German engineering to bomb belgrade this was the first bombing of WW1. 

The Alliance caused conflict as other countries wanting to join for example Serbia and Bosnia turned to unite with Russia as they were Slavic Brothers. Bosnia had a revolution against Austria where Arche duke frans ferdinand was assasinated because they wanted to escape Austria's controll and join russia. This led to the to point ultimatum which would be the reason war broke out. Due to the alliance all the countries were dragged in even ones who did nothing in the Balkans crisis.

There would have been less conflict if alliances weren't made.
","The student begins by addressing the given factor, the Alliance System, and provides some specific knowledge about the alliances formed, such as the Entente Cordiale and the Triple Entente. However, the explanation is somewhat basic and lacks depth. The student mentions that alliances meant countries would be dragged into war, but this point is not fully developed.

In the second paragraph, the student discusses the Balkans crisis and the role of alliances in escalating the conflict. They mention the ""blank check"" given by Germany to Austria-Hungary and the resulting tensions with Russia. There is some specific knowledge shown here, but the explanation is still somewhat basic and lacks coherence.

The third paragraph touches on the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the resulting ultimatum, but the explanation is again basic and lacks depth. The student mentions the involvement of Serbia and Bosnia and their desire to unite with Russia, but this point is not fully developed.

For example, countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England began to worry and they began forming alliances with the entene cordial in 1904 with France and England and the triple extent in 1906 with France England and Russia. This ment if any country went to war they would all get dragged in.

The alliances also escalated the balkans crisis into major war as Austria Hungary had been given a blanc check by Germany as they had full suport. It also created tension between Russia (not wanting to look weak) and Germany. Due to Russias pride they refused to step down to Germany. France a russian aly began preparing for war due to Russides actions. Austria would use German engineering to bomb belgrade this was the first bombing of WW1. 

The Alliance caused conflict as other countries wanting to join for example Serbia and Bosnia turned to unite with Russia as they were Slavic Brothers. Bosnia had a revolution against Austria where Arche duke frans ferdinand was assasinated because they wanted to escape Austria's controll and join russia. This led to the to point ultimatum which would be the reason war broke out. Due to the alliance all the countries were dragged in even ones who did nothing in the Balkans crisis.

There would have been less conflict if alliances weren't made.

","### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - **Spelling:**
     - ""entene cordial"" should be ""Entente Cordiale.""
     - ""extent"" should be ""Entente.""
     - ""ment"" should be ""meant.""
     - ""blanc check"" should be ""blank check.""
     - ""suport"" should be ""support.""
     - ""aly"" should be ""ally.""
     - ""Russides"" should be ""Russia's.""
     - ""Arche duke frans ferdinand"" should be ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand.""
     - ""assasinated"" should be ""assassinated.""
     - ""controll"" should be ""control.""
   - **Punctuation:**
     - Missing commas and periods in several places.
     - Incorrect use of parentheses.
     - Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., ""Europe affairs"" should be ""European affairs"").
     - Missing apostrophes (e.g., ""Russias pride"" should be ""Russia's pride"").

2. **Grammar:**
   - **Effective Control of Meaning:**
     - The overall meaning is clear, but there are several grammatical errors that affect the flow and clarity.
     - Examples of grammatical errors:
       - ""countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England"" should be ""countries that didn’t intervene in European affairs, like England.""
       - ""This ment if any country went to war they would all get dragged in"" should be ""This meant that if any country went to war, they would all get dragged in.""
       - ""Austria Hungary had been given a blanc check by Germany as they had full suport"" should be ""Austria-Hungary had been given a blank check by Germany, as they had full support.""
       - ""France a russian aly began preparing for war due to Russides actions"" should be ""France, a Russian ally, began preparing for war due to Russia's actions.""
       - ""Austria would use German engineering to bomb belgrade this was the first bombing of WW1"" should be ""Austria used German engineering to bomb Belgrade; this was the first bombing of WW1.""

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms related to the topic, such as ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""Triple Entente,"" ""blank check,"" ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" and ""ultimatum.""
   - However, some terms are misspelled or used incorrectly, which affects their effectiveness.

### Final Analysis:

- **Spelling and Punctuation:**
  - The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy but makes several errors that affect the overall clarity.
- **Grammar:**
  - The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, but errors do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.
- **Specialist Terms:**
  - The student uses a limited range of specialist terms, some of which are misspelled or used incorrectly.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student demonstrates a reasonable level of accuracy in spelling, punctuation, and grammar, with errors that do not significantly hinder the overall meaning. The use of specialist terms, although limited and sometimes incorrect, shows an attempt to engage with the topic.

the doorway is the German Kaiser.","From Source A, we can see a depiction of a Russian Bolshevik revolutionist with ‘German gold’ trying to maim what looks out to be the tsarist depiction of Russia, and in the background we can see the German Kaiser Wilhelm the second plotting. Contextually we can infer that sential Communist Lenin was sent from Switzerland to Russia where he was exiled to stir up tensions on Russia so that the Germans could get some relief off the Eastern front. The style of clothing that the Russian Imperialist is wearing represents royalty which ties into the fact that Russia had its monarchy killed during the revolution to show its harsh and neglect that it gave to the Russian people centuries prior. Lenin was sent by Kaiser Wilhelm as he knew a time like this for Russia would be perfect as he was brought major famine and poverty to Russia, so he wanted change.
","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the depiction of the Bolshevik with ""German gold"" and the German Kaiser in the background. They also provide some contextual knowledge, mentioning Lenin's return to Russia and the impact of the Bolshevik Revolution. However, the analysis lacks clarity and focus on how these elements are critical of the Bolsheviks. The student does not explicitly explain how the source is critical of the Bolsheviks, which is necessary for a developed analysis.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to provide a clearer explanation of how the source is critical of the Bolsheviks, supported by more precise factual knowledge. For example, they could explain that the cartoon suggests the Bolsheviks betrayed Russia by making peace with Germany, which allowed Germany to focus its forces on the Western Front, thus harming the Allied war effort.

Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B, the picture depicts a array of soldiers - most likely to be on the Allied forces - crossing over no man's land with shells firing over them at a constant rate. Contextually we know that during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the battle of Passchendaele. In 1917, the British forces were able to tactically redirected the way they used artillery by creating a creeping barrage where in a certain order a certain amount of shells could be fired upfront at the troops to clear any enemy ground/territory, which provided as a explosive shield which now able to give them easier access towards the trench for bayonett charging. This was vital to break the stalemate as a historian can gather the fact that the German forces were overwhelmed at the change in fire rate which  was able to will thousand more proving to be more effective. Due to the smoke after the

explosion, the Germans couldn't also see the advancing troops in front of them which caused major distress. Source C brings the idea of tanks into the question which was a revolutionary idea at the time as there was anything like it. In September 1916 the first battalion of tanks were deployed into the Battle of the Somme which allowed for the ease of movement to continue. Trenches had become ineffective for the Germany as they could have just been ran over. Barbed wire which was a massive problem until this point also became ineffective as tanks could have just flattened them causing no distress from when explosives blew them up which only led to them becoming noisy. The tanks had a 360 turret which was later developed which could shoot from anywhere. In the Battle of Cambrai, 1917 they were able to use the tanks for a circular formation in rows as the Battle of the Somme let only 50 tanks remaining from the 400 used. Towards the end of the war which was a vital asset for the allied victory as the Germans could really fight back.

","The student provides a detailed analysis of both sources, showing a good understanding of the content and contextual knowledge. 

For Source B, the student describes the image and explains the concept of the creeping barrage, linking it to the Battle of the Somme and Passchendaele. They explain how this tactic was used to break the stalemate and overwhelm German forces, providing a clear evaluation of the source's utility. The student also mentions the impact of the smoke from explosions, which added to the effectiveness of the tactic.

For Source C, the student discusses the introduction and development of tanks, referencing their first use in the Battle of the Somme and their effectiveness in overcoming trench warfare and barbed wire. They also mention the Battle of Cambrai and the evolution of tank tactics, highlighting the importance of tanks in the Allied victory.

However, the student does not explicitly evaluate the provenance of the sources, which is necessary for a higher level. They do mention that Source C is from a book by a tank commander, which implies some evaluation of its reliability, but this could be more developed.

Overall, the answer shows developed evaluation of the content of both sources and uses contextual knowledge effectively. To reach level 4, the student would need to provide a more explicit evaluation of the provenance of both sources and discuss the relationship between them.

  example_answer: []",,"In the 19th Century just after the Franco-Prussian war which was a victory for Prussia, Alfred von Schlieffen created a plan which was fairly simple in a way to take out two of Europe’s biggest powers: France and Russia doing this by gathering a number of 750,000 troops, going through Alsace-Lorraine taking out France before diverting for Russia taking both out in the general scheme, however there was major flaws to this. Number one was that sometime before the war, France had created the Maginot line to protect himself from Germany if they were to ever attack again. This meant Germany had to divert for Belgium. However, in 1839 the Treaty of London was signed with Britain giving full support for Belgium as they gained independence from any country willing to attack them. This meant if Germany diverted for Belgium they would face a double threat with Britain joining the war. The Belgian army too would be employed adding resistance towards the Germans. On the Eastern side, Russia before the war was able to muster up men in the course of 4 weeks which wasn't apart of Germany plan as they assumed Russia would be the attack as a surprise. This led to a war on two fronts. The BEF also came in time to support the invasion before the Germans got to Paris.","The student provides a detailed account of the Schlieffen Plan and its intended strategy, which demonstrates a good understanding of the plan's objectives and the historical context. The answer identifies several key issues that led to problems in 1914, such as the diversion through Belgium, the Treaty of London, and the unexpected speed of Russian mobilization. These points are relevant and show specific knowledge.

However, the answer lacks a clear structure and coherent narrative. The student jumps between points without fully developing each one or explaining the consequences in a structured manner. For example, the mention of the Maginot Line is historically inaccurate as it was constructed after World War I, not before. Additionally, the answer does not explicitly link the problems caused by the Schlieffen Plan to the broader context of World War I, such as the resulting stalemate and trench warfare.

To reach Level 4, the student would need to present a more coherent narrative that demonstrates complex sequencing and reasoning, supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge. The answer should also explicitly analyze how each part of the sequence increased tension and led to a crisis.

    - N/A",,"The alliance system in the first World War and the years building up to that was vital for the causes and the actual outcome of the war. I agree with this statement as there were many factors for this argument including: The Brothers alliance, Dual alliance which turned to the Triple alliance and the Entente Cordiale/Entente Alliance. In the late 19th century France and Russia as well as Austria-Hungary and Germany allied to protect themselves from each other in case of a war. The entente cordiale in 1904 was also another reason why tensions fired up with the old Entente and Germany due to the Moroccan crisis. These two events and their conferences started a clear divide in those countries listed as France wanted more colonies however this was disrupting the Kaiser's Weltpolitik which was his world view and the way he wanted to grow his empire doing this by trying to help at Morocco. In the Balkans the tension between the alliances of the Balkan League and the Ottoman empire stirred up causingfor two wars which left that are with nonstop raising tensions. Russia and Serbia had a brotherhood alliance as they were both Slavic. Bosnia another slavic county was going to get annexed by austria (which already had previous tensions with Russia). This angered the Serbains leading the Russians backing them up in justification of a war. The Germans however were not happy with this giving Austria a blank check allowing them for help whenever they need it also giving Russia a ultimatum to stop and back out of Autria-Hungary and Serbian tensions which they desired. 

Another alliance between the French and the Belgians also stopped and aggrovated German plans for WWI in attacking france Belgian led to Britain joining the war which would become a burden for the Kaiser. This caused a massive divide in the Nations of Europe which was a factor of the July crisis which ultimately ended up with the start of world war one. In conclusion we can see that the build up of allinnces between certain countries in Europe and Asia (Japanese and the British) led to a mess as various problems were split through various different nations. This includes Italy who was originally part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria but however to unprecedented events switched to the Entente side by the start of the war.

","The student provides a detailed explanation of the alliance system and its role in causing the First World War. They mention several key alliances, such as the Dual Alliance, Triple Alliance, and Entente Cordiale, and explain how these alliances created tensions and divisions among European powers. The student also discusses specific events, such as the Moroccan Crisis and the Balkan Wars, which further heightened tensions.

The first paragraph demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The student explains the alliances and their impact on international relations, showing a developed line of reasoning. However, the explanation could be more coherent and structured, as the student jumps between different alliances and events without clear transitions.

The second paragraph continues to explain the impact of alliances, particularly focusing on the French-Belgian alliance and its effect on German plans. The student also mentions the July Crisis and the role of alliances in escalating the situation to a full-scale war. This paragraph shows a developed explanation with accurate knowledge, but again, the structure could be improved for better coherence.

The conclusion attempts to summarize the argument, stating that the build-up of alliances led to a complex web of tensions and conflicts. However, the conclusion is somewhat repetitive and lacks a clear, sustained judgement.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 3. The student demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding and provides a developed explanation of the stated factor and other factors. However, the coherence and logical structure could be improved to reach Level 4.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows a depiction of the Western Front with two types of new technology and tactics being shown. The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. 

Source C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C 
describes how the army constantly made new prototypes 
as the tanks so they could be faster and cause 
more casualties. This meant there was less hand to 
hand fighting because of the tanks physiological and 
devastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C 
is useful to a historian because it has personal 
story from someone actually experiencing the power 
of tanks, showing how the threat they brought. ","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and provides a detailed analysis of their content. For Source B, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and its significance in reducing casualties and improving communication during assaults. They also mention the role of radio communication in coordinating attacks, which adds depth to their evaluation. The student concludes that Source B is very useful for understanding the impact and versatility of technology and tactics in the First World War.

For Source C, the student describes the evolution and effectiveness of tanks, particularly the 'Whippets,' during the German Spring Offensive. They highlight the personal account of a tank commander, which adds credibility and a firsthand perspective to the source. The student explains how tanks were initially unreliable but became pivotal in breaking the stalemate on the Western Front. They also mention the psychological impact of tanks on the enemy, further emphasizing their importance.

However, the student could improve their response by explicitly evaluating the provenance of both sources. For example, they could discuss the reliability of a British newspaper published during the war and the potential bias in a post-war memoir by a decorated tank commander. Additionally, they could compare the two sources to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their utility.

Overall, the answer falls into level 3 due to the developed evaluation of the content of both sources. To reach level 4, the student would need to include a more explicit evaluation of the provenance and a comparison of the sources.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan already had some problems to it, even before it was put into practise. For example it relied on the slow mobilisation of Russia. As the Germans would find out, the Russian army mobilised in just 10 days and had already consigned plans to attack in the East. This meant the Germans would have to fight a war on two fronts, exactly what was trying to be avoided. Furthermore after the death of Alfred Von Schlieffen in 1913, the next general made the army smaller for the assault on France, and also missed Holland from the plan entirely. This meant the Germans would have a weaker force in battle, additioning to them having to divide there army in half to fight in two fronts.

The German plan also relied on Belgium’s invasion which they thought would be quick and easy. However, the Belgian army put up stiff resistance trying forts and its small army, slowing down the German advancement. This gave France and Russia time to communicate and mobilise. Furthermore the German army underestimated the pact Britain had with Belgium in the 1890's, supporting its neutralaty. Therefore when they invaded Belgium and entered through France, The BEF was sent out to stop the Germany army. to May 1914 France and the BEF fought the Germans at the battle of Mons, contributing to stalemate the failure of the Schielfen plan.","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond basic analysis. The answer is structured and provides specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The student identifies key issues such as the reliance on the slow mobilization of Russia, the changes made to the plan after Schlieffen's death, and the underestimation of Belgian resistance and British intervention.

The first paragraph explains how the rapid mobilization of Russia forced Germany to fight on two fronts, which was a significant problem. The second paragraph discusses the resistance faced in Belgium and the involvement of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), leading to the failure of the Schlieffen Plan and contributing to the stalemate.

To reach Level 4, the answer would need to display more complex analysis, such as explaining how each part of the sequence increased tension and led to a crisis. The student could also provide more detailed factual knowledge and understanding, such as specific dates and outcomes of battles.

When Britian Russia and France signed the Triple Entente in retaliation of the Triple Alliance Germany used it to complain that they were being circled in. The Triple entente was used to make Germany back down but could of been a factor for war. Once the two sides were created it was clear War was imminent but Germany and its allies were keen for war then in contrast France and Russia and Britain made a pact us Allience to detterent Germany.

However the assasination os archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbia's black hand Gang also was a jumpstart to war. After the Assassin Austria-Hungery blamed Serbia and had intellignce the Black hand Gang was helped by the Serb government this gave the kaiser a motivation for war due to it alliance with Austria - Hungery. The Austrian government gave Serbia a 10 point deal which they agreed to all but one (letting Austrian soldiers into Serbia). Within a

days War was declared. Russia was dragged in due to its alliance with Serbia and the Germans started there Schlieffen plan in the West turning the Balkans war to a world war.

Finally the Moroccan Crisis was another reason why Germany were happy for a war to start.
France wanted to take over Morocco but Germany also wanted to expand its empire so the kaiser sent a warship into the ports of Morocco to show Germany wanted to be part of World affairs too. The French were outraged and a meeting in Algeciras (Spain) with the USA, Britain, Germany and France calmed the situation down preventing early war. The kaiser did this to see how Sent France could be pushed but Germany was humiliated when Britain Supported France due to there alliance. In 1911 the French were called into Morocco to settle a rebellion but Germany accused France of invading the country. Ultimately it was declared France would take full control of Morocco which humiliated the Kaiser for a Second time. He wanted to prove Germany's strength and it was clear he would not back down a third time, therefor 
when Franz Ferdinand was killed, Germany declared War.","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, and explains how it contributed to the outbreak of war. They mention the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, and how Germany felt encircled, which is a relevant point. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge. The student does not fully develop the reasoning behind why the Alliance System led to war, nor do they provide a sustained line of reasoning.

In the second paragraph, the student discusses the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which is another relevant factor. They provide some factual knowledge about the event and its immediate consequences, such as Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia and the involvement of Russia. However, the explanation is somewhat disjointed and lacks coherence. The student does not fully explain how this event led to a wider conflict involving multiple countries.

The third paragraph addresses the Moroccan Crisis, another relevant factor. The student provides some factual knowledge about the crisis and its impact on German and French relations. They mention the meetings in Algeciras and the humiliation of Germany, which are relevant points. However, the explanation is again somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear, sustained line of reasoning.

Overall, the student demonstrates some knowledge and understanding of the factors leading to the First World War, but their explanations are not fully developed. The answer lacks coherence and a sustained line of reasoning, which are necessary for higher levels. The student does not provide a complex explanation of the relationship between the causes, nor do they form a sustained judgement.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The answer contains several spelling errors: ""Britian"" (should be ""Britain""), ""entente"" (should be ""Entente""), ""could of"" (should be ""could have""), ""assasination"" (should be ""assassination""), ""os"" (should be ""of""), ""Hungery"" (should be ""Hungary""), ""intellignce"" (should be ""intelligence""), ""Allience"" (should be ""Alliance""), ""detterent"" (should be ""deterrent""), ""Assassin"" (should be ""assassination""), ""there"" (should be ""their""), ""therefor"" (should be ""therefore"").
   - Punctuation errors are also present: inconsistent use of commas, missing apostrophes (e.g., ""Serbia's black hand Gang""), and incorrect capitalization (e.g., ""In Some ways"").
   - Despite these errors, the overall meaning is not severely hindered.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The grammar is generally understandable but has several issues: ""could of been"" should be ""could have been,"" ""us Allience"" should be ""as an Alliance,"" ""a jumpstart to war"" should be ""a jumpstart to the war,"" ""due to it alliance"" should be ""due to its alliance,"" ""days War was declared"" should be ""days, war was declared,"" ""there Schlieffen plan"" should be ""their Schlieffen plan,"" ""Sent France"" should be ""far France,"" ""there alliance"" should be ""their alliance.""
   - The control of meaning is generally maintained, but the errors do affect the clarity and flow of the argument.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately: ""Triple Entente,"" ""Triple Alliance,"" ""Schlieffen plan,"" ""Moroccan Crisis,"" ""archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Black Hand Gang,"" ""Algeciras.""
   - The range of specialist terms is good, but the accuracy and context of some terms could be improved.

**Conclusion:**
- The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though there are notable errors.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, but the errors do affect clarity.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms as appropriate.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the answer fits best in Level 2, awarding 2 marks.

Let's evaluate this answer against the marking criteria.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating ""they may decide to locate further away."" This satisfies the identification criterion.
  - **Mark: 1**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate explains the way by stating ""on the internet it's very easy to deliver the product being sold."" This provides some explanation but lacks depth.
  - The explanation could be further developed by mentioning how e-commerce allows businesses to operate without a physical retail location, similar to the example answer ""This is because the business can use e-commerce"" and ""As a result, the business may not require a physical retail location.""
  - The explanation is somewhat vague and does not fully develop the point to the extent of the example answers provided in the mark scheme.
  - **Mark: 1**

### Examiner Commentary:
The candidate has identified a way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate by stating ""they may decide to locate further away."" This identification is clear and earns 1 mark. The explanation provided, ""on the internet it's very easy to deliver the product being sold,"" offers some insight but lacks the depth and clarity seen in the example answers. The explanation could be improved by elaborating on how e-commerce reduces the need for a physical retail location or how it allows businesses to choose cheaper locations.

**Analysis:**
- The provided answer does not use the correct formula. The correct formula should be:
  \[
  \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50}

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage: ""A small business meeting legal obligations helps as it builds a reputation with the bank."" This satisfies the first marking criterion. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The explanation provided is: ""having a better chance to get a loan for improvements on products."" This explanation is somewhat relevant but lacks depth and clarity. The mark scheme examples focus on avoiding legal consequences, maintaining a positive image, and motivating employees, which are more direct advantages. However, the candidate's point about building a reputation with the bank and securing loans is a valid business advantage, even if it is not explicitly listed in the example answers. (1 mark)

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate identifies a disadvantage by stating, ""which makes the employee become unhappy."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying a disadvantage, as it highlights the negative impact on employee morale.

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate explains the disadvantage further by stating, ""With this mindset, they won't pay employees won't work as hard as before."" This explanation is partially developed as it connects the unhappiness of employees to a decrease in their work effort. However, the explanation lacks depth and does not fully explore the consequences of decreased employee effort, such as potential impacts on productivity or customer satisfaction.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide a more detailed explanation of the consequences, such as increased recruitment costs or problems meeting customer orders. The candidate's answer does not reach this level of detail.

  - The answer mentions that a business plan ""sets goals for the year such as make X amount of profit."" This is a valid point as setting profit goals is a form of financial forecasting. However, the answer lacks specific financial tools or methods (e.g., cash-flow forecast, break-even analysis) that could be used to forecast success. Therefore, this criterion is partially met.

  - The answer does not provide linked development. It states that the business plan sets profit goals but does not explain how this helps forecast success.

  - The internet will not provide focused information to let Amelia know if there will be enough demand for her plumbing and building services (AO2).
  - Although she knows how many females live in Birmingham, it would be difficult to find out how many of them own a property or would want a female plumber to work in their homes (AO3a).
  - Lili Heating Ltd will be in competition against other established plumbers. Amelia will need to spend more time developing her target market to make sure there are enough potential customers (AO3a).

Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",The secondary information gathered could be less useful depending on dates this is because it could be out of date research tehrefore usless to her business. Another impact for seconday research on Amelia's business is that it could be not relevant to her business. Therefore she would be using data collected thats not even relevant.,"The candidate identifies two potential impacts of using secondary market research. The first impact is that the information ""could be out of date,"" which is a valid point but lacks further development or explanation of how this would specifically affect Amelia's business. The second impact is that the data ""could be not relevant to her business,"" which is again a valid point but is not expanded upon to show the consequences for Lili Heating Ltd.

In terms of application (AO2), the response is limited. The candidate does not provide specific examples or context related to Amelia's business, such as the unique selling point of being a female plumber or the specific needs of her target market in Birmingham. The answer lacks detailed application of business concepts to the specific context of Lili Heating Ltd.

For analysis (AO3a), the response attempts to deconstruct the issue but does so with limited connections between points. The points made are not interconnected, and there is no logical chain of reasoning that shows a deeper understanding of the impact of using secondary market research on Amelia's business.

Given these observations, the response fits the criteria for Level 1:

  - The answer states, ""she is an entrepreneur who will have to pay taxes on all her money meaning that they get more money from her taxes."" This is a valid point and is linked to the reason why the government would want the business to be successful. The answer successfully outlines a reason and links it to the collection of taxes, which aligns with the marking criteria.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are linked. The candidate has connected the success of Lili Heating Ltd with the government collecting more taxes. Therefore, this criterion does not apply as the points are indeed linked.

- **Example answers:**
  - The example answers mention the government collecting more tax if the business is successful and taxes being based on profits. The candidate's answer aligns with these examples by mentioning the collection of taxes from the entrepreneur's earnings. This supports awarding full marks.

- **Award any other valid answer. To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer provides a valid reason and links it to the government's interest in tax collection.

Option 1 is a viable option, however her USP is already that she is a woman which would attract women already, showing that she doesn't need to use option 1. In conclusion, while option one is a good idea option 2 is a great one as it provides free advertising for the business and will often attract more people than just giving out a discount.
","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 would be a better choice, providing a reason that social media wouldn't cost any money and would be easier to gain attraction. This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2), but it is limited and lacks depth. The candidate then briefly mentions Option 1, noting that Amelia's unique selling point (USP) as a woman would already attract female customers, suggesting that Option 1 is unnecessary. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but it is simplistic and not well-developed.

The conclusion reiterates the preference for Option 2, emphasizing the benefits of free advertising and the potential to attract more customers. However, the analysis (AO3a) is basic and lacks interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The justification provided is also limited and does not thoroughly evaluate the business information and issues relevant to the choice made.

    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","The most significant in my opinion is to pay less rent (option 1). This would help significantly because there would be more profit that month to spend on other locations. For example, improving products. 
Although option 2 does have some decent benefits, it can also have downsides. For example, some employees may not take in the information provided and more than likely the training will be very basic and the business will have to pay for extended training.

In conclusion, option is the best as it provides the most significant benefits.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 1 (paying less rent) is the most significant, providing a basic justification that it would result in more profit to spend on other locations or improving products. This demonstrates a limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context of Ripple (AO2), placing it in Level 1.

The candidate then briefly mentions Option 2, noting potential downsides such as employees not absorbing the training information and the need for extended training, which the business would have to pay for. This shows an attempt to deconstruct business information and issues, but the connections between points are limited and not well-developed (AO3a), keeping it in Level 1.

The conclusion reiterates that Option 1 is the best, but it is a simple judgement based on limited evaluation of the information provided (AO3b), further confirming its placement in Level 1.

Price also helps Ripple because with the money provided by customers, they can upgrade technology and make it even cheaper.","The candidate's response is brief and lacks depth. 

1. **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b):**
   - The candidate demonstrates a basic understanding of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. They mention that Ripple claims to be the best-priced energy-efficient company, which attracts customers. However, the explanation is very limited and lacks the use of business terminology. This places the response in Level 1 for AO1b.

2. **Application (AO2):**
   - The application of knowledge to the business context is minimal. The candidate mentions that customers would want cheap energy to have more disposable income for other items, but this point is not well-developed or linked back to Ripple's specific context. The reference to upgrading technology with the money provided by customers is also vague and lacks specific application to Ripple's business model. This places the response in Level 1 for AO2.

3. **Analysis (AO3a):**
   - The candidate attempts to deconstruct the importance of price but does so in a very limited way. There are no interconnected points or logical chains of reasoning. The response lacks depth and detail, which is necessary for higher levels of analysis. This places the response in Level 1 for AO3a.

4. **Evaluation (AO3b):**
   - The candidate makes a simple judgement that price is important because it attracts customers and allows for technological upgrades. However, the justification is very limited and lacks a thorough evaluation of business information and issues. This places the response in Level 1 for AO3b.

Overall, the response is placed in Level 1 due to the limited application, analysis, and evaluation. The candidate demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding but does not develop their points sufficiently to move beyond Level 1.

#### Identification of an advantage:
- **Criteria:** Identification of an advantage.
- **Response:** The answer identifies an advantage: ""any staff that work there will be happier and more likely to stay.""
- **Evaluation:** This satisfies the criteria as it clearly identifies an advantage of meeting legal obligations.
- **Mark:** 1 mark.

#### Explanation of the advantage:
- **Criteria:** Explanation of the advantage.
- **Response:** The answer explains the advantage by stating, ""as there is laws to help make a working environment safe for staff in a business.""
- **Evaluation:** This explanation is somewhat vague but does connect the legal obligations to a safer working environment, which in turn makes staff happier and more likely to stay. However, it could be more explicitly linked to the motivation and productivity of the workforce as per the example answers.
- **Mark:** 1 mark.

  - One disadvantage is that the employees will want to leave the business (1). This means the business may have to find new employees (1). This may increase the recruitment costs of the business (1).
  - The employees may not be motivated (1). This means the productivity of the employees will fall (1). Therefore, the business may experience problems meeting customer orders (1).

The candidate has suggested a disadvantage through 'the employee is likely to leave the business as they aren't being paid on time'. This is developed through 'this means that there are less employees in the business'. However, the candidate does not further develop their answer to explain the implications of having fewer employees.

Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate identifies a disadvantage: 'the employee is likely to leave the business as they aren't being paid on time'. This satisfies the first marking criterion. **1 mark awarded.**

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate begins to explain the disadvantage by stating 'this means that there are less employees in the business'. This partially explains the consequence of employees leaving but does not fully develop the explanation to cover the broader implications, such as increased recruitment costs or difficulties in managing the business.
  - The answer does not reach the depth of explanation seen in the example answers, such as discussing increased recruitment costs or problems meeting customer orders. Therefore, it does not fully satisfy the criteria for the additional 2 marks.

Based on the marking scheme and the provided answer, the candidate's response should be awarded 1 mark for identifying the disadvantage and 1 mark for a partial explanation.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""they won't owe anyone any amount of money."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying an advantage, as it implies that the business does not incur debt. Therefore, 1 mark should be awarded for this identification.

- **Explaining the advantage:**
  - The explanation is provided through ""so they won't be required to pay it back to anyone with possible interest meaning they lose money.""

This aligns with the indicative content that adapting existing products may not be as innovative and may not fully meet changing customer needs (AO1b, AO3a).

  - Using the internet as a source of secondary market research is a fast and convenient way to discover how many females live in Birmingham (AO2).
  - The internet will not provide focused information to let Amelia know if there will be enough demand for her plumbing and building services (AO2).
  - Although she knows how many females live in Birmingham, it would be difficult to find out how many of them own a property or would want a female plumber to work in their homes (AO3a).
  - Lili Heating Ltd will be in competition against other established plumbers. Amelia will need to spend more time developing her target market to make sure there are enough potential customers (AO3a).

Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Because Lili Heating Ltd used the internet for secondary research, the research she has found may not be specific to her business or customer target so she could be using the wrong information. So she could lose money as she hasn't got the correct information for her business.

Also if she uses market research, the information she gathers could be out of date and no longer applied for her business idea. This means that she could be looking at information that doesn't include new businesses in her target market.","The candidate identifies two potential impacts of using the internet for secondary market research. The first impact is that the research ""may not be specific to her business or customer target,"" which is developed through the idea that ""she could be using the wrong information"" and ""could lose money as she hasn't got the correct information for her business."" The second impact is that the information ""could be out of date,"" which is developed through ""she could be looking at information that doesn't include new businesses in her target market.""

In terms of application (AO2), the response includes some contextual elements such as ""Lili Heating Ltd"" and ""her business or customer target,"" but it lacks detailed application to the specific context of Amelia's plumbing business in Birmingham. The response does not mention specific details like the unique selling point of being a female plumber or the competitive market in Birmingham.

For analysis (AO3a), the response provides some logical connections between points, but the chains of reasoning are not fully developed. The candidate identifies potential issues with secondary research but does not explore these issues in depth or provide detailed interconnected points.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - **Evaluation:** The answer ""convenience"" does not explicitly state one of the four elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, Price). The elements of the marketing mix are typically defined as Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. ""Convenience"" could be interpreted as a benefit or a feature but not as a direct element of the marketing mix.
   - **Conclusion:** The answer does not satisfy this criterion.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1:** ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham"" (1)
  - This example clearly identifies ""Place"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 2:** ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (1)
  - This example clearly identifies ""Promotion"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 3:** ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1)
  - This example clearly identifies ""Product"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Marking Notes

- **Application Evidence:** To award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application. The answer ""convenience"" does not provide clear evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Conclusion

The answer ""convenience"" does not explicitly state one of the elements of the marketing mix and does not provide evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for awarding a mark.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer states, ""she is filling a gap in the market so she will make lots of revenue that the government can tax."" This outlines a reason why the government would want the business to be successful, linking the success of the business to increased tax revenue for the government. This satisfies the marking criteria for linked points.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are linked. The candidate connects the idea of filling a market gap to generating revenue, which in turn leads to tax revenue for the government. Therefore, this criterion does not apply as the points are linked.

- **Example answers:**
  - The example answers include points about the government collecting more tax if the business is successful and the business employing more people. The candidate's answer aligns with the example answer about tax collection, as it mentions the government taxing the revenue generated by the business.

- **Award any other valid answer. To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",The business is trying to be the cheapest supplier for energy so the quality of the wind turbines could be bad meaning no energy is made.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria and the context provided.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

#### Criteria: Stating one risk for investors in Ripple

- **Evaluation**: The answer states, ""the quality of the wind turbines could be bad meaning no energy is made."" This implies a risk that poor quality wind turbines could result in no energy production, which is a valid risk for investors. If no energy is produced, investors would not receive the energy they need, which could lead to financial loss or unmet energy needs.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1**: ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" - This example directly states a financial loss.
- **Example Answer 2**: ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs"" - This example states a risk of not receiving sufficient energy.
- **Example Answer 3**: ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy"" - This example states a risk related to market demand.

The given answer aligns most closely with Example Answer 2, as it implies that poor quality turbines could result in no energy production, leading to investors not receiving the energy they need.

### Contextual Application

- **Context**: Ripple is an energy company providing green energy through consumer-owned wind farms. The risk mentioned in the answer is relevant to the context as it directly relates to the quality and functionality of the wind turbines, which are crucial for energy production.

### Marking Notes

- **Application Evidence**: The answer provides evidence of application by mentioning a specific risk related to the quality of wind turbines, which is directly relevant to Ripple's business model of generating energy through wind farms.

### Conclusion

The answer successfully states a risk for investors in Ripple by highlighting the potential issue of poor-quality wind turbines leading to no energy production. This is a valid risk that could affect investors' returns and energy supply.

Let's evaluate this answer against the marking criteria:

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple**:
  - The answer identifies a clear benefit to customers: ""customers are less likely to overpay for energy they don't need."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying a benefit to customers of Ripple. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

- **Linked development and evidence of application**:
  - The answer provides a linked development by explaining why asking questions to identify customer needs is beneficial: it helps customers avoid overpaying for unnecessary energy. This shows a clear link between the action (asking questions) and the benefit (avoiding overpayment). 
  - However, the answer lacks specific evidence of application to Ripple's context. The context mentions that Ripple creates a green energy plan based on customer needs, but the answer does not explicitly reference this process or the unique aspect of Ripple being a consumer-owned wind farm. To fully satisfy this criterion, the answer should have included a reference to Ripple's specific process or business model.

Given the marking notes:
- Award up to 2 marks for linked points outlining a benefit to customers of Ripple.
- Award a maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.
- To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application.

Since the answer provides linked development but lacks specific evidence of application to Ripple's context, it should be awarded 1 mark.

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","Option 2 is better for Ripple as renewable energy methods are fairly new so new employees are less likely to know what they are doing so will struggle to complete their job. So if the Government pays to train them it is easier and cheaper for Ripple to hire new employees.

Also, if the business has trained staff, they won't need to try and hire staff without training meaning they won't break any laws in the employment laws, so they won't be fined, meaning they save money and their reputation as a business.

Also if the government pays for training the business can hire more people as they won't have to pay for training making it easier to manage the business and make it less likely that they are understaffed and can't run the business it could be dangerous.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 is better for Ripple, providing a clear stance. They justify this by discussing the novelty of renewable energy methods and the associated need for training, which is relevant to the context of Ripple (AO2). This application of knowledge is sound but not detailed enough to reach Level 3.

The candidate then mentions the legal implications of hiring untrained staff, which is a valid point but lacks depth and interconnected reasoning (AO3a). The mention of saving money and maintaining the business's reputation is relevant but not fully developed.

Finally, the candidate discusses the potential for hiring more staff if the government pays for training, which is another valid point but again lacks detailed interconnected reasoning (AO3a). The argument about avoiding understaffing and potential dangers is relevant but not thoroughly explored.

Overall, the answer demonstrates sound application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context of Ripple, with some interconnected points and chains of reasoning. However, the evaluation is not thorough enough to reach Level 3.

1. **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b):**
   - The candidate demonstrates a basic understanding of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix by mentioning that the business aims to be the cheapest supplier of renewable energy. However, the response lacks detailed knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues.

2. **Application (AO2):**
   - The application of knowledge to the business context is minimal. The candidate mentions the cost of running and maintaining wind turbines but does not provide any detailed application to Ripple's specific situation or how price impacts its marketing mix.

3. **Analysis (AO3a):**
   - There is an attempt to deconstruct the business information by mentioning the competition and the cost of maintaining wind turbines. However, the connections between points are very limited, and there is no detailed analysis or logical chains of reasoning.

4. **Evaluation (AO3b):**
   - The response lacks a well-reasoned conclusion or a thorough evaluation of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. The candidate does not provide a justification based on a sound evaluation of business information and issues.

Overall, the response is placed in **Level 1** due to the limited application of knowledge, minimal analysis, and lack of detailed evaluation. The response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding but does not go beyond basic assertions.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate identifies an advantage by stating, ""You get to be your own boss."" This is a valid point, although it is not directly related to the specific advantages of a private limited company as outlined in the mark scheme. The mark scheme focuses on limited liability and the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this point does not fully align with the expected answers.
  - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the advantage by adding, ""which means you can pick your own times and you don’t have to."" However, this explanation is incomplete and does not provide a clear, logical connection to the identified advantage. Additionally, the explanation does not align with the specific advantages of a private limited company, such as limited liability or raising finance through shares.
  - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme focus on limited liability and the ability to raise finance through selling shares. The candidate's response does not address these points and instead focuses on being one's own boss and choosing work hours, which are more general advantages of entrepreneurship rather than specific to a private limited company.

**Overall Evaluation:**
- The candidate's response does not meet the criteria for identifying and explaining an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The points made are more general and do not align with the specific advantages outlined in the mark scheme.

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""A business would need to use the internet because it can get popular from media."" This is a valid point as it suggests that the internet can influence the popularity of a business. 
  - **Mark: 1**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the way by adding, ""people would only want to go to a place with wifi/internet services."" This suggests that the availability of internet services can influence customer preferences and thus affect the business location.
  - However, the explanation lacks depth and clarity. It does not fully explain how the internet affects the choice of location in terms of business operations or cost savings, as seen in the example answers.
  - The explanation is somewhat relevant but not fully developed to the extent required for full marks.

The business increases the selling price of its product to 6.50 per unit.

Using the information in Table 1, calculate the decrease in the break even level of output. You are advised to show your workings.","Substitution into correct formula:
£10 000 ÷ (£6.50 – £2.50)
= 2,500 units
Decrease = 4,000 – 2,500 (1)
Answer: 1,500 units (1)",,3200000 units,"To grade the provided answer, we need to check if the student has shown any correct working steps, even if the final answer is incorrect. Let's break down the correct steps according to the mark scheme and compare them with the student's answer.

### Correct Working Steps:
1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   \[
   \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{New Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
   \]

2. **Calculating the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
   \]

### Student's Answer:
- The student provided the final answer as ""3200000 units"" without showing any working steps.

### Grading:
- **Substitution into the correct formula:** The student did not show any working steps, so we cannot award the mark for this part.
- **Final Answer:** The final answer ""3200000 units"" is incorrect.

The candidate's response needs to identify an advantage and then explain it. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate states, ""Customers would be more persuaded to go to a place which has legal obligations and legal properties."" This suggests that meeting legal obligations can attract customers, which can be considered an advantage. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The candidate does not provide a clear explanation of why customers would be more persuaded to go to a place that meets legal obligations. The response lacks further development or linkage to specific benefits such as avoiding legal consequences, maintaining a positive image, or ensuring employee motivation and productivity. The explanation is not sufficiently developed to meet the criteria for additional marks.

#### Identification of an advantage:
- The answer does not clearly identify an advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance.

#### Explaining the advantage:
- The explanation provided, ""as the source of finance will cover pay/ insurance issues in the business,"" is not sufficiently clear or detailed.

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

### Marking Criteria:
- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success.**
  - The answer does not outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. Instead, it mentions ""better equipment and more workers,"" which are potential uses of financial resources but not directly related to how financial information helps forecast success. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks.**
  - The points provided (""better equipment and more workers"") are not linked to the context of how financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. There is no explanation or development connecting these points to the forecasting of success. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark.**
  - Since the points are not linked and do not directly address the question, the response does not meet the criteria for even 1 mark.

### Example Answers:
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme include specific financial tools like a cash-flow forecast or a break-even forecast, and they explain how these tools help in ensuring sufficient cash flow or setting profit targets. The given answer does not mention any such financial tools or provide a similar level of detail.

### Marking Notes:
- To award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. The answer lacks both linked development and evidence of application to the context of financial forecasting.

### Conclusion:
The answer does not meet any of the marking criteria and does not provide a valid point related to how financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. Therefore, the response should be awarded 0 marks.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
