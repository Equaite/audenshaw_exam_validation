  - 3",,You deal and finance with the problems directly,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one advantage'. The candidate's response is ""You deal and finance with the problems directly"". Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate does not clearly identify an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The statement ""You deal and finance with the problems directly"" is vague and does not align with the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - Since the candidate did not identify a clear advantage, there is no explanation provided. The statement ""You deal and finance with the problems directly"" does not explain any specific advantage of a private limited company. Therefore, this criterion is also not satisfied.

### Example Answers Comparison:
- The example answers provide clear advantages such as ""The owners would have limited liability"" and ""The business can sell shares to raise finance,"" followed by detailed explanations. The candidate's response does not match the clarity or detail of the example answers.

### Conclusion:
- The candidate's response does not meet any of the marking criteria. It neither identifies a clear advantage nor provides an explanation.

The candidate's response should be evaluated against the marking criteria and example answers provided in the mark scheme.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""can possibly use a website to promote because a lot of advertisement is done digitally."" This identifies the use of the internet for digital promotion.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate explains the way by mentioning, ""A smaller business means a lower reputation so that means they'll attract less foot traffic in person."" This suggests that due to lower foot traffic, the business might rely more on digital promotion.
  - However, the explanation lacks depth and does not fully develop how using a website for promotion affects the choice of location. The candidate does not explicitly connect the use of a website to the potential for choosing a cheaper or different location due to reduced need for physical presence.

**Example Answers:**
- The example answers provide clear connections between the use of the internet and the choice of location, such as choosing a cheaper location due to e-commerce or needing a location with good internet connections.

**Evaluation:**
- The candidate identifies a way the internet may affect location choice by mentioning digital promotion through a website.
- The explanation is partially developed but lacks a clear connection to how this affects the choice of location. The candidate does not explicitly state that the business might choose a cheaper location or a location with good internet connections due to the use of digital promotion.

6000 units","To grade the provided answer, we need to evaluate it against the mark scheme and check for any correct workings or steps, even if the final answer is incorrect.

Let's break down the mark scheme and compare it to the given answer:

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculating the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's evaluate the provided answer:

- The answer states: ""Selling Price = £6.50 per unit 6000 units""
- There is no clear substitution into the formula or any intermediate steps shown.
- The final answer of ""6000 units"" does not match the expected decrease calculation.

Based on the mark scheme, we can award marks for correct workings even if the final answer is incorrect. However, the provided answer does not show any correct workings or intermediate steps that align with the mark scheme.

The candidate's response needs to identify an advantage and then explain it. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate states, ""They won't have any legal trouble,"" which identifies an advantage. This aligns with the example answer, ""A small business would not get sued for breaking the law."" Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The candidate does not provide a clear explanation of the advantage. Instead, they mention potential negative outcomes, ""but maybe could lose out to companies willing to do things illegally and lose customers that don't follow the law."" This does not develop the initial point about avoiding legal trouble. The explanation should focus on the positive outcomes of meeting legal obligations, such as avoiding financial consequences or maintaining a good reputation, as seen in the example answers. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied. **(0 marks)**

### Examiner Commentary:
The candidate has identified an advantage by stating that the business ""won't have any legal trouble."" However, the explanation provided does not develop this point and instead introduces unrelated negative outcomes. To achieve full marks, the candidate should have explained the positive implications of not having legal trouble, such as avoiding fines or maintaining a good reputation.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer does not directly outline a specific way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. Instead, it focuses on Amelia's need to get financially informed and learn how to run a business. This does not meet the criteria of outlining a specific financial tool or method (e.g., cash-flow forecast, break-even analysis) that could help forecast success. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The response mentions Amelia's need to get financially informed but does not link this to a specific financial tool or method that could help forecast the success of her business. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked and the answer does not provide a specific financial tool or method, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. However, even for 1 mark, the answer should at least mention a relevant financial aspect, which it does not. The response is too generic and does not address the specific requirement of the question.

- ""The business plan could contain a cash-flow forecast for Lili Heating Ltd (1). This would help ensure there was always enough cash to pay for plumbing supplies (1).""
- ""A break-even forecast could be included in the business plan (1). This would set a target of how many female customers were needed to start making a profit (1).""

The answer identifies a non-financial aim, which is Amelia's desire to relate to female customers who may feel more comfortable with a woman performing plumbing work. However, the response does not develop this point further or provide any detailed analysis.

**Level Determination:**

- **Application of Knowledge and Understanding (AO2):** The response shows a limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context.

- **Analysis (AO3a):** The response attempts to deconstruct the business information but finds limited connections between points. There is no detailed analysis or logical chains of reasoning provided.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer ""female leadership"" does not directly state an element of the marketing mix. The marketing mix typically includes Product, Place, Promotion, and Price. ""Female leadership"" does not fit into any of these categories. Therefore, the answer does not satisfy this criterion.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1: ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham""**
  - This example clearly states ""Place"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of distributing services in Birmingham.
  
- **Example Answer 2: ""Promotion methods to attract female customers""**
  - This example clearly states ""Promotion"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of attracting female customers.
  
- **Example Answer 3: ""Product is to repair/install boilers""**
  - This example clearly states ""Product"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of repairing/installing boilers.

### Marking Notes

- **To award 1 mark there must be evidence of application.**
  - The answer ""female leadership"" does not show evidence of application to the marketing mix elements (Product, Place, Promotion, Price).

### Conclusion

The answer ""female leadership"" does not fulfill the marking criteria as it does not state an element of the marketing mix. It also does not provide evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer ""to promote equality"" is a valid reason why the government might want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. However, it lacks linked development. The response does not explain how the success of Lili Heating Ltd would promote equality, nor does it provide any specific context related to the business or the government’s objectives. Therefore, it does not fully meet this criterion.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - Since the answer does not provide linked points or development, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. The response is too brief and lacks the necessary detail to earn the full 2 marks.

- **Example answers:**
  - The example answers provided in the mark scheme include linked points and context, such as ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful"" and ""Amelia may employ more female plumbers if the business is a success."" These examples show the level of detail and linkage required to earn full marks. The provided answer does not meet this standard.

- **Award any other valid answer:**
  - While ""to promote equality"" is a valid point, it needs to be developed further to explain how the success of Lili Heating Ltd would contribute to this goal. For instance, mentioning that Amelia's success as a female plumber could encourage more women to enter the trade, thereby promoting gender equality in a male-dominated industry, would have provided the necessary linkage and context.

Based on the evaluation, the answer ""to promote equality"" is valid but lacks the necessary development and context to earn full marks. Therefore, it should be awarded 1 mark.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",Promote with social media. Just because the company is ran by women doesn't mean you can discount women. Men deserve equality too.,"The candidate's response is very brief and lacks depth. The answer does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the business scenario or the options available to Lili Heating Ltd. There is a mention of promoting with social media, but it is not developed or linked to the context of the business. The comment about equality is not relevant to the business decision at hand and does not provide any business analysis or evaluation.

- **Application of Knowledge and Understanding (AO2):** Limited application. The candidate mentions social media but does not connect it to the business context or explain how it would benefit Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Analysis (AO3a):** There is no deconstruction of business information or issues. The response lacks interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning.
- **Evaluation (AO3b):** No judgement or justification is provided based on the evaluation of business information and issues.

Overall, the response does not meet the criteria for Level 1. It lacks relevant content and does not address the question effectively.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer ""no guarantee"" is vague and does not explicitly state a specific risk. The marking scheme requires a clear and specific risk to be mentioned, such as ""Loss of money invested"" or ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy.""
   - The context provides several potential risks, such as the possibility of not receiving enough energy or the business failing due to lack of demand. However, the answer does not specify any of these risks.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1:** ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" clearly states a specific risk.
- **Example Answer 2:** ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs"" clearly states a specific risk.
- **Example Answer 3:** ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy"" clearly states a specific risk.

The given answer ""no guarantee"" does not match the clarity and specificity of the example answers provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Notes Application

- The marking notes emphasize that to award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application. The answer ""no guarantee"" does not provide sufficient evidence of application to the context of Ripple and its business model.

### Conclusion

Based on the evaluation:
- The answer does not satisfy the criteria of stating a specific risk for investors in Ripple.
- The answer is too vague and lacks the necessary detail to be awarded a mark.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by

Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But

Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and

For Source B, the student mentions the ""creeping barrage"" tactic and explains its purpose. For Source C, the student highlights the effectiveness of tanks, specifically the ""Whippets,"" in combat. However, the analysis lacks depth and detailed contextual knowledge. The student does not evaluate the provenance of the sources or provide extended reasoning related to their utility.

To improve, the student should include more specific factual knowledge and evaluate the provenance of the sources. For example, they could discuss the significance of Source B being published in a British newspaper in 1917 and how it might reflect public morale or propaganda. For Source C, they could mention the author's firsthand experience and the reliability of his account.

The response is presented as general statements and does not provide a structured account or detailed analysis of causation and consequence.

The student identifies that Germany's desire for an empire led to an increase in military power, which caused concern among other global powers. However, this explanation is too simplistic and does not address the specific problems caused by the Schlieffen Plan in 1914, such as the invasion of Belgium, the mobilization of Russian forces, or the resulting stalemate on the Western Front.

They mention the pressure from France, Britain, and Russia on Germany, which is relevant but lacks detailed factual knowledge and developed reasoning. The explanation is simple and does not fully explore the complexities of the Alliance System.

The student then briefly mentions the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand as another cause of the war. This is relevant, but the explanation is very basic and lacks depth. The student does not provide specific details about the event or its consequences, nor do they explain how it led to the broader conflict.

In the third paragraph, the student returns to the Alliance System and mentions the Triple Entente and the alliances involving Belgium. This is relevant and shows some understanding of the alliances, but the explanation remains basic and lacks detailed factual knowledge and developed reasoning.

The conclusion reiterates the student's agreement with the statement but does not add any new insights or detailed analysis. The overall structure of the answer is coherent, but the explanations are too basic to reach higher levels.

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - **Spelling:** The student has generally spelled words correctly. There are a few minor errors such as ""goverment"" instead of ""government"" and ""Britains'"" instead of ""Britain's"".
   - **Punctuation:** The punctuation is mostly accurate, but there are some issues. For example, there is a missing comma after ""Russia"" in the first sentence, and the phrase ""Britains' France's or Russia's allies or colonies"" is awkwardly punctuated.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses grammar with general control of meaning. There are some awkward constructions and minor grammatical errors, such as ""built made tensions high"" which should be ""built up tensions"" or ""made tensions high"".
   - The sentence ""they Britain and France both promised to attack if Germany tried to invade Belgium and try to keep them out"" is grammatically incorrect and confusing. It should be rephrased for clarity.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Triple Entente,"" ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" and ""allies.""
   - The range of specialist terms is good but not particularly wide.

### Conclusion:
- **Spelling and Punctuation:** Considerable accuracy with minor errors.
- **Grammar:** General control of meaning with some awkward constructions and minor errors.
- **Specialist Terms:** Good range of specialist terms used appropriately.

### Final Assessment:

This represents the allies frustration against russia and especially the bolsheviks as they left the war and had signed a peace treaty with Germany giving up significant portions of valueable land.
","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the Bolsheviks 'backstabbing the allies' and the presence of Kaiser Wilhelm II. They also provide some contextual knowledge about the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the peace treaty with Germany. However, the analysis is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not fully explain how these features are critical of the Bolsheviks or provide extended reasoning supported by detailed factual knowledge. 

To reach Level 2, the student would need to develop their analysis further, explaining how the Bolsheviks' actions were perceived as a betrayal by the Allies and how this is depicted in the cartoon.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B, we can see an image displaying the tradectory of artillery bombardments. The allies use the cover created by the smoke and explosions to advance through no-mans land with the element of surprise. This allowed it so that the enemy would have a difficult time discerning where the enemy were attacking from. This form of tactical manouvering is known as a 'creeping barrage'. The allies would time artillery bombardment at certain angles and simultaneously the soldiers would 'creep in'.

Tanks were first introduced in the battle of the Somme 1916, but were largely inneffective as they were slow (only reaching speeds of 4 mph), many tactics were

not developed for them as the British thought of not much use for them. But by 1917 and 1918, tanks were being deployed in large rows of 200-300 tanks which would cross over no-mans land and destroy the barbed wire defences. In source C, we see the mention of machine guns on the tanks as they were added as a way to bring more firepower. These machine guns were mounted on and could turn 360 degrees to inflict damage upon the enemies.","The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the content of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student describes the use of artillery bombardments and the tactic of the 'creeping barrage,' which is a valid point related to military tactics during the First World War. For Source C, the student mentions the introduction and development of tanks, specifically the 'Whippets' and their use in battle, which is also relevant to the question.

However, the evaluation of the sources is not fully developed. The student does not provide a detailed analysis of the provenance of the sources, which is necessary for higher-level responses. Additionally, the contextual knowledge provided is somewhat limited and could be expanded to include more specific details about the effectiveness and impact of these tactics and technologies during the war.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to:
1. Provide a more detailed evaluation of the provenance of both sources, explaining how the origin, purpose, and context of the sources affect their utility.
2. Include more specific contextual knowledge to support the analysis, such as the outcomes of battles where these tactics and technologies were used.
3. Make explicit connections between the content of the sources and their usefulness to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was heavily reliant on Russia taking a long time to mobilize and a very quick and decisive win against France (in 40 days). The plan was to have a large bulk of the German army invade France by cutting into Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to surprise the French, who would be anticipating an attack directly into France on the boarder between them. However, the Schlieffen plan failed as Russia only took 10 days to mobilize (faster than expected) and Belgium put up a fierce and resistance fight against the Germans (much more resistance than Germany had anticipated). Ultimately, invading through Belgium only helped the stalemate last longer as Britain was forced to join the war effort as invading Belgium initiated an 1843 treaty of London where Britain vowed to protect Belgium. This prolonged the war significantly, turning 40 days into 4 years.
","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer identifies key elements of the plan, such as the reliance on Russia's slow mobilization and the quick defeat of France, and explains how these expectations were not met. The student also highlights the unexpected resistance from Belgium and the involvement of Britain due to the 1843 Treaty of London.

The analysis shows a clear understanding of causation and consequence, moving beyond a basic narrative. The student explains how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a prolonged war, turning a planned 40-day campaign into a four-year conflict. This demonstrates a developed sequencing and reasoning supported by accurate factual knowledge.

To reach Level 4, the answer would need to display more complex analysis, such as discussing the broader implications of the stalemate and trench warfare, and how these factors increased tension and led to a crisis. The answer could also benefit from more detailed factual knowledge and understanding of the events that followed the initial failure of the Schlieffen Plan.

The alliances were the main trigger for many of the events, wars and crises that led up to world war one. The black hand (a terrorist group) assasinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the heir to the austrian-hungarian throne) leaving only serbia to blame for the assasination. Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany. Then Germany invaded Belgium bringing Britain into the war as it triggered the 1843 treaty of London which Britain vowed to protect Belgium from invading forces. Because of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's death,Europe was involved in an all-out war.

In 1871, shortly after Germany's unification, Germany and Austria-Hungary made an alliance together as they both shared similar cuteral identities,had shared the same common language of German and were politically close to each other. Later, the Italians joined the dual alliance to form the triple alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. In 1892, France and Russia formed an alliance together. This was a threat towards Germany as it meant they could be attacked from either the East or the West. Later in 1904, Britain formed an alliance with France, known as the Entente Cordiale (Friendly alliance). Then in 1906, Britain, France and Russia all came together to form the triple Entente. The alliance system made political disputes more intense as one disagreement could lead to a major war. This is clearly seen in the Moroccan crisises and the Balkan wars. The involvement of this many countries made it impossible to avoid an all  out war from breaking out in Europe, thus causing the start of World War One.","The student provides a clear explanation of the stated factor, the Alliance System, and supports this with accurate and detailed knowledge. The explanation of how the alliances led to the escalation of the conflict following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand is well-developed and shows a good understanding of the chain of events. The student also explains the formation of the alliances and how they created a divided Europe, which increased the likelihood of a large-scale war.

However, the answer primarily focuses on the Alliance System and does not provide a complex explanation of other factors that contributed to the outbreak of the First World War. To reach Level 4, the student would need to include and explain other significant factors, such as militarism, imperialism, and nationalism, and how these interrelated with the Alliance System to create a complex web of causes leading to the war.

In 1871, shortly after Germany's unification, Germany and Austria-Hungary made an alliance together as they both shared similar cuteral identities,had shared the same common language of German and were politically close to each other. Later, the Italians joined the dual alliance to form the triple alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. In 1892, France and Russia formed an alliance together. This was a threat towards Germany as it meant they could be attacked from either the East or the West. Later in 1904, Britain formed an alliance with France, known as the Entente Cordiale (Friendly alliance). Then in 1906, Britain, France and Russia all came together to form the triple Entente. The alliance system made political disputes more intense as one disagreement could lead to a major war. This is clearly seen in the Moroccan crisises and the Balkan wars. The involvement of this many countries made it impossible to avoid an all  out war from breaking out in Europe, thus causing the start of World War One.","### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""assasinated"" should be ""assassinated""
     - ""austrian-hungarian"" should be ""Austro-Hungarian""
     - ""cuteral"" should be ""cultural""
     - ""crisises"" should be ""crises""
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some issues:
     - Missing commas in compound sentences (e.g., ""The black hand (a terrorist group) assasinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the heir to the austrian-hungarian throne) leaving only serbia to blame for the assasination."" should have a comma after ""throne"").
     - Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., ""serbia"" should be ""Serbia"").
     - Missing spaces after commas (e.g., ""identities,had"" should be ""identities, had"").

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some errors:
     - ""Europe was divided in two different camps"" should be ""into two different camps.""
     - ""The alliances were the main trigger for many of the events, wars and crises that led up to world war one"" should be ""World War One.""
     - ""Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests"" should be ""a couple of requests.""
     - ""Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany"" should be ""Germany declared war on Russia, and France declared war on Germany.""
     - ""cuteral identities,had shared the same common language of German"" should be ""cultural identities, shared the same common language of German.""

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""alliance system,"" ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Austro-Hungarian,"" ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""triple Entente,"" ""Moroccan crises,"" and ""Balkan wars.""

### Final Analysis:

- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, but there are some errors that prevent it from being consistent accuracy.
- **Grammar:** The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, but there are some errors that slightly hinder the flow.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student demonstrates a performance that fits well within **Level 2**. The errors present are not severe enough to drop the student to Level 3, and the use of specialist terms is strong.

However, the analysis is somewhat confused and lacks clarity. The student mentions ""stealing gold"" and ""Bosnia,"" which are not directly relevant to the context of the Bolsheviks and the First World War. There is an attempt to explain the meaning of ""BETRAYED,"" but it is not well-supported by factual knowledge or understanding of the historical context.

To improve, the student should focus on the key elements of the source and provide more accurate contextual knowledge. For example, they could explain that the cartoon is critical of the Bolsheviks because it shows them dragging Russia towards Germany, symbolizing the betrayal of the Allies by making peace with Germany in 1918. This allowed Germany to concentrate its forces on the Western Front, which was detrimental to the Allied war effort.

  - 3",,One advantage of starting a business as a private limited company is that the business will have money and will not be able to struggle and may already have customers.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one advantage'. The candidate's response needs to identify an advantage and then explain it.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate states, ""One advantage of starting a business as a private limited company is that the business will have money."" This is not a clear identification of an advantage specific to a private limited company. The mark scheme expects advantages like limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The candidate continues with ""and will not be able to struggle and may already have customers."" This explanation is vague and does not clearly relate to the specific advantages of a private limited company as outlined in the mark scheme. The explanation does not develop the initial point in a way that aligns with the expected answers, such as explaining limited liability or the ability to raise finance through selling shares. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

**Example Answers for Reference:**
- ""The owners would have limited liability (1)""
- ""This means that any debts are the responsibility of the business (1)""
- ""Therefore, the personal possessions of the owners will not have to be sold to pay the debts of the business (1)""
- ""The business can sell shares to raise finance (1)""
- ""This is good because the business may have extra funds for investment (1)""
- ""This may lead to a reduction in the chance of business failure (1)""

**Identification of a way (1 mark):**
- The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""The internet may rate it based on its location if it’s in a bad area it will be rated badly."" This is a valid point as it suggests that online reviews and ratings can influence the perception of a business's location. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

**Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
- The candidate attempts to explain the way by adding, ""If it’s in a good area it may will be rated good."" This partially develops the initial point but lacks depth in explaining how this affects the business's choice of location.
- The candidate further states, ""The internet would also help a business to choose location depending on an area where sales are high."" This is another valid point, suggesting that online data can help identify high-sales areas, but it is not fully developed to explain the mechanism or impact.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide a clear identification and detailed explanation of how the internet affects location choice, such as using e-commerce to choose cheaper locations or needing good internet connections for communication. The candidate's answer does not reach this level of detail and clarity.

**Marking Notes:**
- The candidate's answer lists more than one way but does not fully explain either. According to the marking notes, this would limit the answer to a maximum of 1 mark.

**Total Marks:**
- Based on the criteria and the marking notes, the candidate's answer should be awarded 1 mark. The identification of a way is clear, but the explanation lacks sufficient development to earn additional marks.

Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

Each wave protects you from a plane and from bombs dropping on you.

In Source C it Shows that the german Soilder were preparing an attack on the british tank, but then 7 of the newest and fastest tanks named whippets came and drove straight into the german Soilders and scattered them in all directions, which this had destroyed the German threat. This helps the students studying military technology understand about how fast and powerful the Whippet was.

For Source B, the student notes that British soldiers are advancing under an artillery barrage and explains the tactic of running in waves to avoid being hit by artillery. For Source C, the student describes how the new Whippet tanks were used to scatter German soldiers and eliminate the threat.

However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include sufficient factual knowledge or extended reasoning. The student does not evaluate the provenance of the sources or explain how the content and provenance make the sources useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. The answer also lacks a clear focus on the utility of the sources, which is necessary for higher-level responses.

To improve, the student should:
1. Provide more detailed factual knowledge about the tactics and technology used in the First World War.
2. Evaluate the provenance of the sources, considering who created them, when, and why.
3. Explain how the content and provenance of the sources make them useful to a historian.

- **Identification of a way:**
  - The answer does not clearly identify a specific way a small business could become more competitive. The statement ""A small business to be more competitive could find what products are having an increase in sales in certain places where many customers go"" is vague and does not directly identify a competitive strategy. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied. (0 marks)

- **Explanation of the way:**
  - The explanation provided is unclear and lacks depth. The candidate mentions that identifying products with increasing sales in popular locations ""could lead to an increase in profit,"" but does not explain how this would make the business more competitive. The explanation does not align with the example answers provided in the mark scheme, which clearly link the identified way to a competitive advantage. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

#### Identification of an advantage:
- **Criteria:** Identification of an advantage.
- **Evaluation:** The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""this could make people want to work for a business by following a legal obligation like employee's wage or discrimination.""
- **Mark Awarded:** 1 mark.

#### Explanation of the advantage:
- **Criteria:** Explanation of the advantage.
- **Evaluation:** The explanation is somewhat vague and lacks depth. The candidate mentions ""following a legal obligation like employee's wage or discrimination"" and ""paying them on time,"" but does not clearly link these actions to specific benefits such as increased employee motivation, productivity, or avoiding legal consequences. The explanation does not fully develop how meeting legal obligations leads to the advantage identified.
- **Mark Awarded:** 0 marks.

### Total Marks Awarded: 1 out of 6

### Justification:
- The candidate successfully identifies an advantage by stating that meeting legal obligations could make people want to work for the business.
- However, the explanation is not sufficiently developed to show how this leads to specific benefits for the business, such as increased motivation or productivity, or avoiding legal issues.
- According to the mark scheme, a well-explained advantage should link the action to a clear benefit, which this answer fails to do.

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The answer identifies a disadvantage: ""Employees could eventually sue the job."" This is a valid point as it highlights a potential legal issue for the business. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The answer attempts to explain the disadvantage by stating, ""could leave lots of negative things about the job and people will not want to work here."" This explanation is somewhat vague but does touch on the potential reputational damage and difficulty in attracting new employees. However, it lacks depth and clarity compared to the example answers provided in the mark scheme.
  - The explanation does not fully develop the consequences of the disadvantage, such as increased recruitment costs or decreased productivity, which are more clearly articulated in the example answers.

#### Identification of an Advantage
- **Criteria:** Identification of an advantage.
- **Evaluation:** The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""By a business using retained profit as a source of finance it gain profit it makes them instead of having to pay the money back and borrowing it.""
- **Mark Scheme Reference:** The mark scheme lists ""Interest is not paid on retained profit"" and ""Retained profit is a cheap source of finance"" as examples of advantages.
- **Conclusion:** The answer successfully identifies an advantage, as it implies that retained profit does not need to be repaid, aligning with the idea that it is a cheap source of finance.
- **Mark Awarded:** 1 mark.

#### Explaining the Advantage
- **Criteria:** Explaining the advantage.
- **Evaluation:** The explanation provided is somewhat unclear and lacks depth. The candidate states, ""it gain profit it makes them instead of having to pay the money back and borrowing it,"" which suggests that retained profit does not incur repayment obligations. However, the explanation is not fully developed or clearly articulated.
- **Mark Scheme Reference:** The mark scheme expects a clear explanation, such as ""Interest is not paid on retained profit"" leading to ""The business would not experience an increase in costs.""
- **Conclusion:** The explanation is partially there but lacks clarity and depth. It does not fully explain the advantage in a coherent manner.
- **Mark Awarded:** 1 mark (partial credit for an attempt at explanation).

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer does not directly outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. Instead, it discusses the unique selling point (USP) and word-of-mouth recommendations, which are not directly related to financial information. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are not clearly linked. The response mentions the USP and potential savings on advertising costs due to recommendations, but it does not link these points to how financial information in the business plan could help forecast success. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked and the response does not directly address how financial information could help forecast success, it does not meet the criteria for 2 marks. However, the answer does mention potential savings on advertising costs, which is a relevant business consideration, albeit not directly tied to financial forecasting. Therefore, it can be awarded 1 mark for mentioning a relevant business consideration.

This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence. This was to see how far France would push. And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support.

Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state.","To assess the student's answer, I will evaluate it against the criteria provided in the Mark Scheme for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG). I will also consider the use of specialist terms as appropriate.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""Morrocan"" should be ""Moroccan.""
     - ""Morroco"" should be ""Morocco.""
     - ""britian"" should be ""Britain.""
     - ""rebillion"" should be ""rebellion.""
     - ""tukey"" should be ""Turkey.""
   - Punctuation is generally used correctly, but there are some issues:
     - The sentence ""This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence."" is a run-on sentence and could be broken down for clarity.
     - The sentence ""And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support."" starts with ""And,"" which is generally discouraged in formal writing.
     - The sentence ""Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state."" lacks clarity and proper punctuation.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student demonstrates a general control of grammar, but there are some issues:
     - The phrase ""which this had France wanted to take over Morroco"" is awkward and unclear.
     - The sentence ""And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support."" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammatical correctness.
     - The sentence ""Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state."" is grammatically incorrect and unclear.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses some specialist terms such as ""Moroccan crisis,"" ""kaiser,"" and ""allies.""
   - However, the range of specialist terms is limited, and the explanation lacks depth and precision.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the student's answer demonstrates:
- Considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, though there are several errors.
- General control of grammar, but with some awkward and unclear sentences.
- A limited range of specialist terms.

Given these observations, the student's performance aligns most closely with **Level 2** in the Mark Scheme. However, considering the forgiving nature of the grading, I will award the higher end of the Level 2 marks.

  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).
  - As a result, she would be determined to succeed as there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. This could give her an extra incentive to do well. (AO3a).
  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

   - However, the Answer does not explicitly state ""Product"" or any other element of the marketing mix. It is somewhat implied but not clearly stated.
   - According to the Mark Scheme, an example answer for ""Product"" is: ""Product is to repair/install boilers."" This example clearly states the element and provides a specific detail.
   - The Answer does not meet the clarity and specificity shown in the example answers from the Mark Scheme.

### Conclusion:
- The Answer does not explicitly state one element of the marketing mix.
- The Answer is vague and does not clearly fulfill the criteria of stating an element of the marketing mix as required by the Mark Scheme.

Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer does not provide linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. The response focuses on the perspective of female customers rather than the government's interest. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The response does not link the points to the government's interest. It states, ""Because many female customers feel that they can relate more easily with doing repairs in their house,"" which is a valid point but not linked to why the government would want the business to be successful. Thus, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme focus on the government's interest, such as tax collection and employment. The given answer does not align with these examples as it does not mention any government-related benefits.

**Marking Notes:**
- The marking notes specify that to award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. The given answer lacks both linked development and application to the government's perspective.

This is because if a woman gets a discount this could be forwarded to other women which is another way of promoting a business by people sharing it and telling friends and family. This could help towards promoting a business. Overall this will lead to an increase in profit and having an increase in profit for Lili heating LTD is good as she has just started and will not need to struggle of survival. And option 2 that doesn't help as much as option 1 towards business growth.,"The candidate begins by stating that Lili Heating Ltd should consider Option 1, which is to offer a discounted price to female customers. This is followed by a justification that focuses on the potential for word-of-mouth promotion, which is relevant to the business context (AO2). However, the application of business concepts is limited and lacks depth, placing AO2 in Level 1.

The analysis (AO3a) is basic and does not provide interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The candidate mentions that word-of-mouth promotion could lead to increased profit, but this is not developed further. There are limited connections between points, placing AO3a in Level 1.

The evaluation (AO3b) is also limited. The candidate makes a simple judgement that Option 1 is better for business growth but does not provide a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made. This places AO3b in Level 1.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",This can make one person own a share in a lot depending on how much. So a person can own more of a share. And they can lose out on more and can go bankrupt as they are a small business.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria: 
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""And they can lose out on more and can go bankrupt as they are a small business.""
   - This statement does identify a risk, which is the potential for investors to ""lose out on more"" and ""go bankrupt."" This aligns with the example answer in the mark scheme, ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm.""
   - The context supports this risk as it mentions that customers invest money into the wind farm, and there is an inherent risk in any investment, especially in a small business.

### Conclusion:
- The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, which is the potential loss of money and the possibility of going bankrupt. This is supported by the context and aligns with the example answers provided in the mark scheme.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer does mention a benefit to customers by stating, ""This will create a green energy plan to establish how much a customer should invest into Ripple."" This aligns with the marking criteria as it identifies a benefit to customers. However, the benefit is not clearly articulated in terms of how it directly benefits the customer, such as ensuring they receive the correct amount of energy for their needs or getting the best return on their investment. Therefore, this part of the answer partially satisfies the criteria.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer attempts to provide linked development by stating, ""This will be favorited by people. People will recommend this business and people will use their services. This will lead into an increase in profit, as they are a small business."" However, this development is more focused on the benefits to Ripple rather than the customers. The marking scheme requires the benefit to be customer-centric, such as receiving the correct energy plan or investment return. The development provided does not sufficiently link back to the direct benefit to the customer, thus failing to meet this criterion fully.

- **Contextualization:**
  - The answer does not provide sufficient contextualization specific to Ripple's operations or the unique aspects of its business model, such as being a consumer-owned wind farm or the focus on green energy. The context provided is generic and does not demonstrate a clear understanding of Ripple's specific benefits to its customers.

**Overall Marks:**
- The answer identifies a potential benefit but lacks clear articulation and linked development focused on the customer. It also lacks sufficient contextualization specific to Ripple. Therefore, the answer should be awarded 1 mark out of the possible 2 marks.

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",this will help the business from not being able to struggle if the price is right ig its a good price people will recommend it to other people and this will help the business growth by telling family and friends can help to lead into an increase in profit.,"The candidate's response is very limited and lacks depth.

Instead, it discusses the advantages of a business being a Public Limited Company (PLC), which is irrelevant to the question. Therefore, no marks can be awarded based on the provided mark scheme.

Let's break down the criteria:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**: The answer does not identify any way in which the internet may affect the location choice of a small business. It talks about selling shares to businesses and shareholders, which is unrelated to the question. No mark awarded.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**: Since no relevant way is identified, there is no explanation provided that relates to the internet's impact on business location. The explanation given is about reducing the risk of business failure and making sales, which does not pertain to the question. No marks awarded.

Answer: 1,500 units (1)",,2500 units,"Based on the provided Mark Scheme, the grading should consider both the correct working and the final answer. Let's break down the Answer and compare it to the Mark Scheme:

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The formula for the break-even level of output is given by:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values from the question:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The Answer correctly identifies the new break-even level of output as 2,500 units.

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output should be:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The Answer does not include this step or the final decrease value.

**Grading:**
- **Substitution into the correct formula:** The Answer correctly calculates the new break-even level of output as 2,500 units. This step is worth 1 mark.
- **Final decrease calculation:** The Answer does not provide the final decrease value of 1,500 units, which is required for the second mark.

**Final Mark:**
- Award 1 mark for the correct substitution and calculation of the new break-even level of output.
- Do not award the second mark as the final decrease calculation is missing.

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The answer identifies a disadvantage: ""the small business may get sued by the employees for not being paid on time."" This satisfies the first marking criterion.

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The explanation is developed with: ""This leads to the business being forced to pay a fine or paying the employees' wage/salary."" This provides a clear consequence of the identified disadvantage.
  - The answer further develops the explanation by stating: ""As a result of this, the small business may fail or become bankrupt due to the money they owe."" This links the initial disadvantage to a potential severe outcome for the business.

The candidate has successfully identified a disadvantage and provided a well-developed explanation of the consequences, aligning with the example answers in the mark scheme. The response is focused and coherent, addressing the question directly.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""the business won't have to worry as the business still have the sufficient funds to cover their total costs."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying an advantage. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

- **Explaining the advantage:**
  - The explanation provided is somewhat vague and lacks depth. The candidate states, ""This leads to the business not making a loss and they keep doing what they usually do. As a result of this, the business would not fail."" While this does provide some explanation, it does not clearly link to the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as not paying interest, not increasing costs, or not diluting ownership.
  - The explanation does not clearly articulate how retained profit specifically contributes to these outcomes. The mark scheme examples provide more direct and clear explanations, such as ""Interest is not paid on retained profit"" or ""The owner(s) keep full control of all decisions made since no new shares are issued.""
  - Given the lack of clarity and direct linkage to the specific advantages in the mark scheme, this part of the answer does not fully satisfy the criteria for explaining the advantage. (0 marks)

This leads to the business acknowledging the gaps in the market and potentially make the business more successful.,"**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""it can help you to forecast the potential success of the business,"" which is a valid point. However, it lacks specific financial information such as cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis that would directly help in forecasting success. Therefore, this criterion is partially met.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer attempts to link the idea of forecasting success with acknowledging gaps in the market, but it does not clearly explain how financial information specifically helps in identifying these gaps. The linkage is weak and lacks clarity. Thus, this criterion is not fully satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not effectively linked and the explanation is somewhat generic, the answer does not meet the requirement for 2 marks. It can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide specific financial tools (cash-flow forecast, break-even forecast) and link them directly to practical outcomes (ensuring enough cash for supplies, setting profit targets). The given answer lacks this specificity and clear linkage.

Secondary market research may be outdated and may be used by other competitors. This leads to Amelia’s providing the same type of service as other competitors.

Another impact of using the internet to collect secondary research is that since it’s outdated, the business would not be fulfilling customers' needs and wants in the present.

As a result of this, the business would fail.","The candidate identifies two impacts of using secondary market research for Lili Heating Ltd. The first impact is that the business may fail due to outdated information and competitors using the same data. This is developed through the idea that Amelia would provide the same type of service as her competitors, leading to a lack of customer attraction. The second impact is that outdated research would result in the business not fulfilling current customer needs and wants, leading customers to choose competitors' services, which could also result in business failure.

In terms of **Analysis (AO3a)**, the candidate provides interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning for both impacts. However, the reasoning is somewhat repetitive and lacks depth. The candidate does not explore other potential consequences or provide a detailed analysis of how these impacts would specifically affect Lili Heating Ltd beyond the general statement that the business may fail.

For **Application (AO2)**, the response includes some contextual elements such as ""Amelia,"" ""competitors,"" and ""customers' needs and wants."" However, the application is not detailed or specific to the context of Lili Heating Ltd and the unique selling point of Amelia being a female plumber.

   - The answer states, ""One element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd is Quality.""
   - **Evaluation:** The term ""Quality"" is not one of the traditional elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, Price). Therefore, this does not satisfy the criteria of stating an element of the marketing mix.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1:** ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham (1)""
  - This example clearly states ""Place,"" which is a traditional element of the marketing mix.
- **Example Answer 2:** ""Promotion methods to attract female customers (1)""
  - This example clearly states ""Promotion,"" another traditional element of the marketing mix.
- **Example Answer 3:** ""Product is to repair/install boilers (1)""
  - This example clearly states ""Product,"" another traditional element of the marketing mix.

### Marking Notes

- **Application Evidence:** The answer must show evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd.
  - The provided answer does not show how ""Quality"" is specifically applied to Lili Heating Ltd in the context of the marketing mix.

### Conclusion

- The answer does not fulfill the marking criteria as it does not correctly identify an element of the marketing mix.
- The answer does not provide evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer provides a reason: ""she's a woman providing services to other people."" However, it does not explicitly link this to why the government would want the business to be successful. The mark scheme requires a clear link to the government's interest, such as tax collection or employment benefits. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked to the government's interest. The response focuses on the comfort of female customers but does not connect this to a broader governmental benefit. As a result, this criterion is met, and the answer can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers in the mark scheme provide clear links to the government's interest, such as tax collection or employment. For instance, ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful"" directly ties the business's success to a governmental benefit. The given answer does not make such a connection.

**Conclusion:**
- The answer does not fully satisfy the marking criteria for linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful.
- The answer does not provide a clear link to the government's interest, thus only meeting the criteria for a maximum of 1 mark.

This leads to more people acknowledging the business and use their service. And as a result of this, more sales would be made within the services they provide.

Another reason is that offering a discounted price to female customers would lead to less money being made because of the discount. This would lead to a loss of revenue and as a result of this, the business would need to find gaps in the market to receive more money.

Another reason of using social media to promote the business is that it doesn't cost any money. This leads to the business attracting more customers without spending any money. And as a result of this, more sales would be made.","The candidate begins by stating that the business should use social media to promote itself. This is a clear judgement and is developed with some reasoning, indicating an understanding of the business context (AO2). However, the explanation is somewhat basic and lacks depth, which places it in Level 1 for AO2.

The candidate then discusses the disadvantages of offering discounted prices to female customers, suggesting it would lead to a loss of revenue. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but the reasoning is limited and not fully developed, keeping it within Level 1.

The final point reiterates the benefits of using social media, emphasizing that it doesn't cost money and can attract more customers. This point is valid but again lacks detailed interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning (AO3a), which places it in Level 1.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",They would receive a limited amount of energy to their homes depending on how much they've invested.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria and the context provided.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""They would receive a limited amount of energy to their homes depending on how much they've invested.""
   - This statement identifies a potential risk for investors, which is the limitation on the amount of energy they receive based on their investment. This aligns with the marking criteria of stating a risk.

### Context Evaluation

- The context mentions that ""customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested."" This supports the answer's claim that the amount of energy received is dependent on the investment.
- The context also states that ""the amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs,"" which further supports the idea that there is a direct correlation between investment and energy received.

### Marking Notes Evaluation

- The marking notes require evidence of application to award 1 mark. The answer applies the context by referring to the specific mechanism of how energy is supplied based on investment, which is a direct application of the provided information.

### Example Answers Comparison

- The example answer ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs (1)"" is very similar to the given answer. Both highlight the risk of receiving limited energy based on investment, which is a valid risk for investors.

### Conclusion

The answer successfully meets the marking criteria by stating a risk for investors in Ripple and provides evidence of application by referring to the context. Therefore, the answer should be awarded 1 mark.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer mentions that ""Ripple is using primary market research and is trying to find the gaps in the market."" This statement does not directly address the benefit to customers but rather focuses on Ripple's strategy. Therefore, this part of the answer does not satisfy the marking criteria.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer continues with ""This will lead to customers' needs and wants being fulfilled,"" which is a valid point. However, it lacks specific linkage to the context of Ripple's green energy plans or how it directly benefits the customers. The statement ""as a result of this, Ripple would attract more customers into investing in the business"" focuses more on the benefit to Ripple rather than the customers. Therefore, the linked development is weak and lacks sufficient evidence of application to the context provided.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales.

This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","In order to help small business, the government should consider to reduce the tax paid by small businesses. This would lead to small businesses giving less tax and use the money to cover total cost, staffs, wages/salary, or use the money to improve the products or services they aid. This would lead to small businesses attracting more customers into the business and as a result of this, the small businesses wouldn’t fail or get bankrupt.

Another reason is that providing free training if small businesses recruit new employees wouldn’t help massively as Option 1 helps them save more money than Option 2. This would lead to more risks in the business failing as they might not have enough money to cover total cost. As a result of this, the business may fail.

Another reason is that the money the small businesses have left over, they could use that money to help charities or people in need. This would lead to a decreased amount of homeless and poor people. And as a result of this, the poverty rate of that area or country would decrease.","The candidate's response begins with a general statement about the benefits of reducing taxes for small businesses, which is relevant but lacks specific application to Ripple (AO2). The answer then discusses how reduced taxes could help small businesses cover costs and improve products or services, which is a valid point but again lacks specific context to Ripple's situation. The mention of attracting more customers is relevant but not sufficiently detailed.

The second paragraph argues that free training for new employees would not be as beneficial as tax reduction, suggesting that saving money is more critical. This point is somewhat relevant but lacks depth and specific application to Ripple's context (AO2). The candidate does not provide interconnected points or logical chains of reasoning (AO3a).

The third paragraph introduces the idea of using leftover money to help charities, which is a valid point but not directly relevant to the question of which option would have the most significant impact on Ripple's success. This point is more about social responsibility than business success and lacks direct application to Ripple (AO2).

Overall, the response demonstrates limited application of business concepts to the specific context of Ripple and lacks detailed interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning. The evaluation is simple and not based on a thorough analysis of the business information and issues relevant to Ripple.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",,No Answer is provided.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War as, in the source there is a tactic being implemented in which shells were fired and due to this smoke and dust rises up which creates a barrier for soldiers to follow behind, this process would then be repeated hour by hour increasing the distance by each shot this also led to enemies being pushed back, and this process was repeated until eventually the enemy trench was reached and soldiers could dive in. This process was called artillery barrage, additionally Source B would also be useful to a historian due to the fact that the source was made by a British newspaper this hints to the fact that the newspaper is going to want to present the tactic as being flawless. On the other hand Source C is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the first World War because, the Source is talking about tanks and their new versions, this is useful as it is showing how the British went from tanks that were sent out in ones which led to them being easily picked out and broken by tanks being upgraded and being sent out in groups of 7's, 10, 20's etc, due to the tanks being sent out in groups this led to mass destruction and caused the German soldiers to be scared, it also nullified things such as barbed wire as the tanks could just go over them and flatten them causing the soldiers to be able to easily pass through without being cut, the tanks also provided cover, due to their size and speed multiple soldiers could follow from behind, and the tanks were also upgraded from just having a big cannon that took a long time to turn to having machine guns at the top that could turn a whole 360°, this is useful as it shows the evolution in weapons.","The student provides a detailed analysis of both sources, showing understanding of the content and some contextual knowledge. For Source B, the student explains the tactic of artillery barrage and how it was used to advance soldiers towards enemy trenches. They also mention the provenance, noting that it was published in a British newspaper, which might present the tactic as flawless. This shows a simple evaluation of the content and provenance, placing it in Level 2.

For Source C, the student describes the use of tanks, specifically the newer 'Whippets,' and how they were effective in battle. They mention the evolution of tank technology and tactics, such as tanks being sent out in groups and having machine guns that could turn 360°. This shows a developed evaluation of the content, but the evaluation of the provenance is less detailed. The student does not explicitly mention that the source is a first-hand account from a tank commander, which would add to its usefulness.

To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of both sources, including a more detailed analysis of the provenance and how it affects the utility of the sources. They should also evaluate the relationship between the sources, such as how they show different aspects of military technology and tactics during the First World War.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 3 due to the developed evaluation of the content of both sources, but it lacks the complex evaluation of provenance and the relationship between the sources needed for Level 4.

  example_answer: []",,"the Schlieffen plan led to problems in 1914 as this is when the German's thought they could quickly invade France, however they weren't able to, this is due to different factors an example being the Franco-Prussian alliance, the alliance between France and Russia, although the Germans knew of this alliance they didn't think Russia was prepared for war, however due to the Russians having to back out of multiple wars such as when Austria-Hungary wanted to invade Bosnia, they had been rigorously preparing for any sort of conflict, another factor was the fact that France also had an alliance with Britain, the Entente Cordiale, this led to when Russia was going on their way to invade France, the British sending soldiers to assist France. This led to the German's having to send a big part of their soldier's to deal with The British, furthermore, another factor was the fact that the Germans were running out of resources. Although Germany did invade a large portion of France they still hadn't invaded it whole, this eventually led to them having to dig out trenches and for the British, French, and Russians to have to fight to win back the territory lost, the German trenches were also significantly better than the British and French due to the fact they had already won the land. This eventually led to a stalemate between both sides.","The student provides a narrative that touches on several key points related to the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences. The answer identifies the failure of the Schlieffen Plan due to various factors, such as the Franco-Russian alliance, the Entente Cordiale, and the unexpected preparedness of Russia. The student also mentions the involvement of British troops and the eventual stalemate resulting from trench warfare.

The answer demonstrates a structured account with specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question, moving it beyond Level 1. The student shows a simple analysis of causation/consequence by explaining how the alliances and the preparedness of Russia affected the German advance, placing it in Level 2.

However, the answer lacks the depth and detail required for Level 3. The analysis is not fully developed, and the sequencing and reasoning are not as clear or detailed as they could be. The student does not provide a range of accurate factual knowledge or a well-ordered narrative that demonstrates developed sequencing and reasoning.

To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide a more detailed and structured narrative, with developed analysis of how each factor contributed to the failure of the Schlieffen Plan and the resulting stalemate.

Another example is the fact that the British only got involved due to the fact that Russia invaded Belgium and England had an alliance with Belgium, which caused England to come out of their isolationaism. Furthermore another example of this is the fact that Russia only joined the war due to past tension in which Germany supported Austria-Hungary and also because they had an alliane with France. Britan only joined due to the alliane with Belgium and France. France only joined due to past tensions in which Kaiser Wilhelm II didn't agree with France having to have some degree of control in Africa and invading Morocco and also due to the fact they got invaded.

They mention Russia's support for Bosnia, Germany's Blank Cheque to Austria-Hungary, and Britain's involvement due to its alliance with Belgium. These points demonstrate specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question.

However, the explanation lacks depth and coherence in some areas. For instance, the student incorrectly states that Russia invaded Belgium, which is factually inaccurate. Additionally, the explanation of why Britain and France joined the war is somewhat muddled and could be clearer.

The student does not fully develop the reasoning behind the alliances and their impact on the escalation of the war. The answer would benefit from a more structured approach, clearly explaining the motives and rivalries that led to the formation of the alliances and how these alliances contributed to the outbreak of the war.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a simple explanation of the stated factor and other factors, with specific knowledge and understanding. However, it lacks the developed reasoning and coherence required for higher levels.

And USA only joined the war due to their ships being constantly sunk and due to a good relationship with Britain.","### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - **Spelling Errors:**
     - ""isolationaism"" should be ""isolationism.""
     - ""alliane"" should be ""alliance"" (appears twice).
     - ""Britan"" should be ""Britain.""
     - ""emphaises"" should be ""emphasizes.""
   - **Punctuation Errors:**
     - The sentence structure is generally correct, but there are some missing commas that could improve readability.
     - The use of quotation marks around 'Slavic brothers and sisters' is correct.
     - The sentence ""Furthermore another example of this is the fact that Russia only joined the war due to past tension in which Germany supported Austria-Hungary and also because they had an alliane with France."" could benefit from a comma after ""Furthermore.""

2. **Grammar:**
   - The grammar is generally good, but there are a few areas where it could be improved for clarity:
     - ""Another example is the fact that the British only got involved due to the fact that Russia invaded Belgium and England had an alliance with Belgium, which caused England to come out of their isolationaism."" This sentence is somewhat confusing and could be rephrased for clarity.
     - ""This emphaises how the Alliance system was the main reason for the first World War as if there was no alliances the first World War might not even have happened."" This sentence is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better flow.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The answer uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Blank Cheque,"" ""isolationism,"" ""alliance,"" and references to specific countries and historical events.
   - The range of specialist terms is good, but not particularly wide.

### Final Assessment:

- **Spelling and Punctuation:**
  - There are several spelling errors and some punctuation issues, but they do not severely hinder the meaning.
- **Grammar:**
  - The grammar is generally good, with some areas needing improvement for clarity.
- **Specialist Terms:**
  - The use of specialist terms is good but not extensive.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- **Level 1:** Requires consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation, effective control of grammar, and a wide range of specialist terms.
- **Level 2:** Requires considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of grammar, and a good range of specialist terms.
- **Level 3:** Requires reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, some control of grammar, and a limited range of specialist terms.

### Conclusion:

The student answer demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, with some errors that do not severely hinder meaning. The grammar shows general control, and the use of specialist terms is good but not extensive. Therefore, the answer fits best in **Level 2**.

The candidate has suggested a way through ""if a small business chooses to locate in the centre of a town where fixed costs will be high"". This is developed through ""they may not make any sales inside the store but make sales online"". The candidate then does not further develop their answer. Overall, this answer should be awarded 2 marks.

### Marking Criteria Analysis:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""if a small business chooses to locate in the centre of a town where fixed costs will be high"". This satisfies the identification criterion.
  - **Mark: 1**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate explains the way by stating, ""they may not make any sales inside the store but make sales online"". This partially explains the impact of the internet on the business location choice.

3375 units","To grade the provided answer, let's break down the steps according to the mark scheme and see if any marks can be awarded for correct working.

### Mark Scheme Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - Decrease in break-even level of output:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Answer:**
   - The final answer should be 1,500 units.

### Provided Answer Analysis:
- The provided answer does not follow the correct formula for calculating the break-even level of output.
- The calculations shown are:
  \[
  5 \times 4000 = 20000
  \]
  \[
  6 \times 3375 = 20000
  \]
  - The answer given is 3375 units, which is not correct.

### Grading:
- **Substitution into the correct formula:** The provided answer does not show the correct formula or substitution. Therefore, no mark can be awarded for this part.
- **Final Answer:** The final answer of 3375 units is incorrect. Therefore, no mark can be awarded for this part.

The candidate has suggested a disadvantage through 'If a small business is not paying their employees they may look for alternative jobs' and this is developed through 'it could lower their work ethic and not be as productive as they could be'. The candidate then does not further develop their answer. Let's evaluate the response against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate identifies a disadvantage: 'If a small business is not paying their employees they may look for alternative jobs'. This satisfies the first marking criterion. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate explains the disadvantage by stating 'it could lower their work ethic and not be as productive as they could be'. This partially explains the consequence of not paying employees on time, but it lacks further development such as the impact on the business, e.g., increased recruitment costs or problems meeting customer orders. According to the mark scheme, a fully developed explanation should include such details. Therefore, this part of the answer is only partially developed. (1 mark)

Overall, the candidate's response identifies a disadvantage and provides a partial explanation. The answer should be awarded 2 marks.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""Retained profit is good for a small business as they save up little each month but eventually they will have a lot of money after saving up."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying an advantage. Therefore, 1 mark should be awarded for this part.

- **Explaining the advantage:**
  - The explanation provided is that the accumulated retained profit ""will help out with their small business and be able to make their business expand."" This explanation is somewhat vague and does not directly address the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as being a cheap source of finance, not paying interest, or not diluting ownership. However, it does imply that the retained profit can be used for business expansion, which is a valid point but not explicitly listed in the mark scheme. Given the marking notes, this explanation is not sufficiently developed to warrant full marks for explanation.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer does not directly outline a specific way financial information could help forecast success. Instead, it mentions understanding the target market and investment, which are not explicitly financial information. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points mentioned in the answer are not clearly linked. The statement ""understanding who their target market is"" is not directly connected to ""how much they will invest into the business and how long it will take."" Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

1. **First Aim: Completing Work to the Highest Standard**
   - The candidate states that Amelia aims to complete her work to the highest standard possible. This is developed through the idea that satisfied customers will recommend her to their families and friends, leading to more jobs and a successful business. This shows a clear understanding of how non-financial aims can impact business success through word-of-mouth marketing.

2. **Second Aim: Unique Selling Point**
   - The candidate mentions Amelia's unique selling point of being a female plumber, which she believes will help her relate more closely to female customers. This is a valid point and shows an understanding of how non-financial aims, such as creating a unique market position, can influence business decisions.

**Application (AO2):**
- The response includes some contextual elements such as ""highest standard possible,"" ""recommend her to their families and friends,"" and ""unique selling point."" However, it lacks specific details about the competitive environment in Birmingham or Amelia's previous experience, which would have strengthened the application.

**Analysis (AO3a):**
- The response attempts to deconstruct the impact of non-financial aims but lacks detailed interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning. The explanation of how high standards lead to recommendations is clear but not deeply analyzed. The unique selling point is mentioned but not fully explored in terms of its impact on Amelia's decision-making process.

- The response shows a limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the business context (Level 1 for AO2).
- The analysis is basic and lacks depth, with limited connections between points (Level 1 for AO3a).

Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Using secondary market research is good for a small company like Lili Heating Ltd because it is free information which may help her advance in her small business. However, using secondary market research is bad for a small company like Lili Heating Ltd because it may not give her the information that she may of needed. Information is important for a small business as it helps the business who their target audience is.","The candidate's response identifies both a positive and a negative impact of using secondary market research for Lili Heating Ltd. The positive impact is that it is ""free information which may help her advance in her small business."" The negative impact is that ""it may not give her the information that she may have needed."" 

However, the response lacks depth and detailed application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the specific context of Lili Heating Ltd. The candidate does not provide any specific examples or detailed reasoning to support their points. The response also lacks interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning.

In terms of AO2 (Application), the response is limited. The candidate mentions ""Lili Heating Ltd"" and ""small business,"" but does not provide any specific contextual details about Amelia's business or the market she operates in.

In terms of AO3a (Analysis), the response is also limited. The candidate makes basic points but does not develop them with detailed reasoning or interconnected points.

Based on the mark scheme:

- **Level 1**: Limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2). Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).
- **Level 2**: Sound application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context although there may be some inconsistencies (AO2). Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding interconnected points with chains of reasoning, although there may be some logical inconsistencies (AO3a).
- **Level 3**: Detailed application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context throughout (AO2). Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a).

### Marking Criteria

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**

   - **Evaluation:** The answer states, ""She will be getting good promotion from people houses she works on which will increase the work she gets."" This statement identifies ""promotion"" as the element of the marketing mix. The term ""promotion"" is explicitly mentioned, which aligns with the example answer in the mark scheme: ""Promotion methods to attract female customers (1).""
   
   - **Conclusion:** The answer successfully states one element of the marketing mix, which is ""promotion.""

### Evidence of Application

- **Evaluation:** The answer mentions that the promotion will come from ""people houses she works on,"" which implies word-of-mouth promotion. This is supported by the context, which states, ""Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families."" This shows a clear application to the specific business context of Lili Heating Ltd.
  
- **Conclusion:** The answer provides evidence of application by linking the promotion to the specific strategy of word-of-mouth recommendations mentioned in the context.

  - The answer does provide a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful: ""she is improving and helping people's lives by fixing all things that people need to live.""

","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.

Whereas if she chose Option 1, she would not be finding that many new customers and she would be making less on each job she does which is why I think Option 2 is a better option.","The candidate's response is brief and lacks depth. 

**Application (AO2):**
- The candidate demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the business context. They mention that Amelia will be able to get more jobs and make more profit, but this is not sufficiently developed or contextualized to Lili Heating Ltd. There is no detailed reference to the specific business scenario or unique selling points.

**Analysis (AO3a):**
- The analysis is basic and lacks interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The candidate states that Option 2 will lead to more jobs and profit but does not provide a detailed explanation or deconstruct the business information and issues effectively. The reasoning is simplistic and does not explore the implications or potential challenges in depth.

**Evaluation (AO3b):**
- The judgement is simple and based on limited evaluation. The candidate concludes that Option 2 is better because it leads to more jobs and profit, but this is not thoroughly justified with a sound evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made. The response lacks a balanced consideration of both options and does not provide a clear justification based on thorough evaluation.

Overall, the response fits the criteria for Level 1:
- Limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context.
- Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points.
- Makes a judgement, providing a simple justification based on limited evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",If there is a lack of wind then Ripple will not be creating energy for people who have signed up for energy.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""If there is a lack of wind then Ripple will not be creating energy for people who have signed up for energy.""
   - This statement identifies a specific risk related to the dependency on wind for energy production. If there is insufficient wind, the wind farm will not generate energy, which directly impacts the investors who rely on this energy supply.
   - The risk is clearly articulated and directly related to the context of Ripple's business model, which is based on wind energy.

### Evidence from the Context:
- The context mentions that Ripple is a wind farm providing green energy. The dependency on wind is implicit in the nature of a wind farm.
- The answer aligns with the context as it highlights a potential operational risk (lack of wind) that could affect energy production and, consequently, the investors.

### Comparison with Example Answers:
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme include risks such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" and ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy.""
- The given answer is similar in nature as it identifies a specific operational risk that could lead to a failure in energy production, which is a valid concern for investors.

### Conclusion:
- The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, fulfilling the marking criteria.
- The risk is specific, relevant, and supported by the context of Ripple's dependency on wind for energy production.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""they get a source of energy for cheaper than other brands,"" which is a valid benefit to customers. This aligns with the marking criteria that require outlining a benefit to customers of Ripple. The context provided in the context section supports this as Ripple claims it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. Therefore, this part of the answer satisfies the marking criteria.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer continues with, ""and they also help the environment whilst doing so as well.""

    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",I think Ripple should choose option 2 to provide free training if businesses recruit new employees so they can sell their electricity to more people so Ripple can make more electricity for more homes and it will be helping the environment as well. I think option 1 is bad because the company (Ripple) will make more money however it is not as good for the environment which is why Option 2 is a better option.,"The candidate's response is brief and lacks depth. They state that Ripple should choose option 2, providing free training for new employees, and offer a basic justification that this will allow Ripple to sell more electricity and help the environment. However, the explanation is not well-developed and lacks detailed application of business concepts and issues to the context of Ripple (AO2). 

The candidate also mentions option 1, suggesting it is not as good for the environment, but this point is not elaborated upon. The response does not demonstrate interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a) or a thorough evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b).

Overall, the response shows limited application of knowledge and understanding, with simple connections between points and a basic judgement. Therefore, it fits the criteria for Level 1.

Due to their price being lower than their competitors, this makes Ripple more appealing to being able to buy energy for cheaper than what the usual bigger companies are selling it for.","The candidate begins by stating that Ripple's price is better than its competitors, which makes it more cost-effective for customers. This is a valid point and aligns with the indicative content that Ripple claims to supply energy cheaper than its competitors. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed application to the business context (AO2).

The candidate also mentions that Ripple is an eco-friendly company that creates zero emissions, which is relevant to the context but not directly related to the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. This point could have been better integrated into the discussion of how price and eco-friendliness together make Ripple more appealing.

The response attempts to deconstruct the business information by linking lower prices to increased appeal, but the connections between points are limited and not fully developed (AO3a). The candidate does not provide a thorough evaluation or a well-reasoned conclusion based on the information provided (AO3b).

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B, the picture shows a section Of British soldiers advencing under artilery bourrage. The picture was published in a British newspaper and and could be an awareness to show the changes of technology to the citizens of great Britain. In this case, the changes in technology could be the artillery due to its raw increase accuracy and fire rate. Another charge in technology was fighter planes. The way that the fighter get could damage people and find them was due to a savee secret compartment where they could throw bombs out of it creating the havoc among the soilders on the groud. Some planes had a camera attached to the plane so it could take a birds eye view picture to find and locate the exact co-ordinates to attack them. However, In Source C It tells the reader about a tank operator called Frank Mitchell who is writing about his experiences in the spring offensive in 1918. He was describing his experiences using tanks and how powerful they could be. They quickly destroyed German trench. Shows how this new machine could stop anything in its track and even was a defense mechanism to stop the new machine guns.

To an Historian these & other sources are both useful in there own use. Source B describes the way artillery barrage had become worse and more accurate to the enemy soldiers. Source C also shows the way new technology such as tanks can help the opposition win the war.","The student begins by describing the content of Source B, noting that it shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage. They suggest that the picture, published in a British newspaper, could be intended to raise awareness among British citizens about technological advancements, specifically in artillery. The student also mentions fighter planes and their capabilities, although this is not directly related to Source B. This part of the answer shows some understanding of the source but lacks detailed evaluation and contextual knowledge.

In the second paragraph, the student describes Source C, which is an account by Frank Mitchell, a tank commander, about his experiences during the German Spring Offensive in 1918. The student notes that Mitchell describes the effectiveness of the new 'Whippet' tanks in destroying German soldiers and emphasizes the power and defensive capabilities of tanks. This part of the answer shows a better understanding of the source and some contextual knowledge.

The final paragraph attempts to evaluate the usefulness of both sources to a historian. The student states that Source B shows the increased accuracy and impact of artillery, while Source C demonstrates the effectiveness of new technology like tanks. However, the evaluation is not fully developed, and the student does not provide a complex reasoning related to the utility of the sources based on their content and provenance.

Overall, the answer shows some understanding of the sources and their content but lacks detailed evaluation and contextual knowledge. The student does not fully address the provenance of the sources or provide a complex evaluation of their utility.

The student identifies that the Schlieffen Plan involved Germany accessing France and mentions the involvement of British troops, but the explanation is vague and lacks specific factual details. The narrative is not well-structured, and there is no clear analysis of causation or consequence.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to provide a more structured account with specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. For example, they could explain how the German advance through Belgium was slowed down by fighting Belgian and British troops and how this led to the need for both sides to build trenches.

The main two alliances were the triple alliance which involved Germany Austria-Hungary, and Italy and the 'triple Entente' consisted of Russia, France and Britain. The morrocon Crisis could also include the alliances because it forced Britain to get involved when Germany decided to ignore there heed of war. The collapse of the Ottoman empire could also be a cause of the main cause. because Austria Hungary attacked Serbia it got Russia involved and then got Germany involved due to their alliance.

The way Germany handed a 'blank cheque' over to Austria-Hungary could also have started the argument or the main cause due to it presenting almost a brotherhood to both countries making them a powerful combination.

In my opinion, the alliances is a massive factor of the first World war and It is in fact the main cause, however it also shows how both alliances divided to fight against each other and how the other countries composed of loyalty but also betrayal. ","The student begins by acknowledging the Alliance System as a cause of the First World War but also mentions other potential causes. However, the introduction lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to follow the argument.

In the second paragraph, the student lists the main alliances and briefly mentions the Moroccan Crisis and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. However, the explanation is fragmented and lacks depth. The student does not provide a detailed explanation of how these events contributed to the war, nor do they link them effectively to the Alliance System.

The third paragraph mentions Germany's ""blank cheque"" to Austria-Hungary but again lacks detailed explanation and context. The student does not fully explain the significance of this event or how it contributed to the escalation of the conflict.

The conclusion reiterates the student's opinion that the Alliance System was a significant factor but fails to provide a coherent and substantiated argument. The answer lacks a sustained line of reasoning and does not demonstrate a range of accurate and detailed knowledge.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate's explanation revolves around the idea that being outside the center of town or a popular area might result in fewer customers. However, this explanation does not relate to the internet's impact on location choice. The response lacks any mention of e-commerce, internet connectivity, or online communication, which are relevant to the question. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

So for example if you had a level 5 health and safety which is a legal obligations more people might want to try and buy your product.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one advantage'. The candidate's response should be evaluated against the marking criteria and example answers provided in the mark scheme.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate identifies an advantage by stating ""more customers."" This aligns with the mark scheme's requirement to identify an advantage. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the advantage by providing an example: ""if you had a level 5 health and safety which is a legal obligations more people might want to try and buy your product."" This explanation is somewhat aligned with the mark scheme's example answers, which discuss avoiding negative consequences and improving business reputation. However, the explanation is not fully developed and lacks clarity on how meeting legal obligations directly leads to more customers. The candidate does not explicitly connect the legal obligation to customer trust or business reputation, which would have strengthened the explanation. Therefore, this criterion is partially satisfied. (1 mark)

**Example Answers:**

- The candidate's response does not fully align with the example answers provided in the mark scheme. The example answers provide a clear cause-and-effect relationship between meeting legal obligations and the resulting advantage, such as avoiding financial consequences or improving employee motivation.

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).

Option 1: sounds very sexist as its only a discount for women not men as this may bring hate or bad reviews into the business.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 should be chosen, providing a brief justification that social media is a great advertising resource. This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2), but the explanation lacks depth and context specific to Lili Heating Ltd. The candidate then briefly mentions Option 1, suggesting it sounds sexist and could bring negative reviews, which is a valid point but is not developed further.

The answer shows limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the business context (AO2). The analysis (AO3a) is minimal, with only basic connections between points. The judgement (AO3b) is simple and lacks thorough evaluation.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer ""stock market crash"" does not directly relate to the specific context of Ripple, which is an energy company providing green and renewable energy through a consumer-owned wind farm. The context does not mention Ripple being publicly traded or its performance being directly tied to the stock market. Therefore, this answer does not fulfill the criteria of stating a risk specific to investors in Ripple.
   - The mark scheme examples such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" or ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy"" are directly related to the business model and operations of Ripple. The provided answer does not align with these examples.

- The answer ""stock market crash"" does not satisfy the marking criteria as it does not provide a risk specific to investors in Ripple, based on the context provided.

    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B is useful to a historian because it shows a tactic called creeping barrage. This tactic was made so that Britain could gain some land and push the Germans back. In the picture it shows that artillery shells would be fired in front of the troops which would be giving the troops cover to jump into shell holes. This tactic worked majority of the times, but had one big problem. The shells were going so close that if they were fired wrong then they would kill their own soldiers.

Source C is useful to a historian because it talks about the development of tanks. At first tanks were slow which made them an easy target for the germans. The british used the tanks in large groups followed by soldiers. The tanks would provide cover for soldiers and they could destroy barbed wire so the troops could get through later on tanks were improved they were faster and better weapons on board for example bigger shells and turrets. The turrets meant that they could fire fast and in 360°. ","The student demonstrates a basic understanding of both sources and provides some simple evaluation of their content. For Source B, the student identifies the tactic of the creeping barrage and explains how it worked, mentioning the potential risk of friendly fire. This shows a basic level of analysis and some factual knowledge, but it lacks depth and extended reasoning.

For Source C, the student discusses the development of tanks, mentioning their initial slowness and subsequent improvements. The student explains how tanks provided cover for soldiers and could destroy barbed wire, but again, the analysis is quite basic and lacks detailed contextual knowledge.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to provide more detailed factual knowledge and extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources. For example, they could discuss the specific battles where the creeping barrage was used effectively or the impact of the Whippet tanks on the outcome of the German Spring Offensive.

But this meant that the Germans had to go through Belgium which they thought wouldn't be a problem. However, as they came to the Belgium border they refused to let the Germans through. The Germans then declared war on Belgium. This was a bad decision for Germany as now Britain joined to protect the Belgians. They had eventually got through Belgium and arrived at the French border. 
 
They then declared war on France. The British then asks for Americas help which then meant that the Germans had another army to fight. By this time Russia had mobilized and declared war on Germany. This created a problem for the germans as they were fighting two wars on two fronts which meant that the schlieffen plan had failed.","The student provides a basic narrative of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond level 1 by identifying relevant events and showing some understanding of causation and consequence.

I think that this was one of the causes but not one of the main ones.  ,"To assess the student's answer according to the Mark Scheme, we need to evaluate the spelling, punctuation, and grammar (SPaG) as well as the use of specialist terms. Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling:
- The student spells all words correctly. There are no spelling errors in the response.

### Punctuation:
- The student uses punctuation marks correctly. The sentence ""I agree with this statement to a certain degree."" ends with a period.
- The sentence ""I think that this was one of the causes but not one of the main ones."" is punctuated correctly, though it could benefit from a comma for clarity: ""I think that this was one of the causes, but not one of the main ones.""

### Grammar:
- The student uses grammar with general control of meaning. The sentences are coherent and the meaning is clear.
- The use of ""I agree with this statement to a certain degree"" and ""I think that this was one of the causes but not one of the main ones"" shows a good grasp of grammatical structure, though the second sentence could be slightly improved with a comma.

### Specialist Terms:
- The student does not use any specialist terms related to the topic of the First World War or the Alliance System. The response is quite general and lacks specific historical terminology.

### Evaluation:
- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy. There are no significant errors that hinder understanding.
- **Grammar:** The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning. The sentences are clear and understandable, though not particularly complex.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student does not use a wide range of specialist terms, which is a requirement for Level 1. The response is quite general and lacks depth in terms of historical terminology.

### Conclusion:
Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme, the student's response fits best into **Level 2**. The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy and uses grammar with general control of meaning. However, the lack of specialist terms prevents the response from reaching Level 1.

### Marks Awarded:
- **3 marks**: The student meets the criteria for Level 2 with considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of grammar, but lacks a wide range of specialist terms.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```",Sources B and C are useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War as in source B they show the advancement of technology and show how Britian attacked the Germans. It also gives them a picture of actually what it would have looked like in no mans land. Source C is also useful as it shows that tanks made a massive impact in the war and were very powerful. This shows that tanks were very effective and are useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in World War One.  ,"The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides a basic analysis of their content. For Source B, they mention the advancement of technology and how Britain attacked the Germans, and for Source C, they highlight the impact and effectiveness of tanks. However, the analysis lacks depth and specific factual knowledge to support the points made. The evaluation of the sources' utility is also quite simplistic and does not delve into the provenance or the broader context of the sources.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed analysis and extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources. This would include discussing the provenance of the sources, such as the fact that Source B was published in a British newspaper in 1917, which might reflect the British public's perception of the war at that time. For Source C, they could discuss the significance of the author's firsthand experience as a tank commander and how this adds credibility to the account.

Overall, this answer falls into Level 1 and should be awarded 3 marks. To improve, the student should aim to provide more detailed factual knowledge and a more thorough evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources.",1,3,12,1.0,1.0,False,1.0,0.045454545454545456,,,,,4.0574791431427,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 24320, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.1216, 'completion_tokens': 231, 'completion_cost': 0.003465, 'total_cost': 0.125065}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 269, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.001345, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.00136}"

They also estimated that it would take the Russians 10 weeks to mobilize but this happened much sooner and caused Germany to have to fight the war on two fronts. Due to their poor estimations and assumptions, this led to huge problems as the Germans couldn't afford to fight the war on two fronts. They struggled getting food and supplies to both fronts and were slowly being worn down and soldiers began to die of starvation. ","The student identifies the key elements of the Schlieffen Plan and its failure, moving beyond level 1 by demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer is structured and shows a simple analysis of causation/consequence, placing it in level 2. The student explains how the Germans underestimated the French resistance and the speed of Russian mobilization, leading to the problem of fighting a war on two fronts. 

However, to reach level 3, the answer would need to provide a more developed analysis with a range of accurate factual knowledge and understanding.

Firstly as Russia, USA and Britain formed an alliance this could have caused Germany massive problems as they were now outstrengthened as they have far less soldiers and supplies than the triple alliance had which made a huge impact as more weapons and vehicles could be made but not for the Germans. The main cause of the world war could have been the assassination of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand. The Duke was visiting Sarajevo, Bosnia. Serbia formed a group called the black hand which was a group of young men and they planned to assassinate Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand. They all lined up in different positions on the street the Duke was driving down, the first guy threw a hand grenade which failed, so he drank poison and jumped into water which turned out to only be about 3 feet deep so he didn't drown and was then arrested. All the other young men failed too, so they met up and were annoyed that the plan failed. One of the men walked to the shop and got a sandwich. Coincidentally the Arch Dukes car had made a wrong turning and was now driving straight towards him so he pulled his gun out and shot him and his wife who both later died in hospital. This caused countries to start declaring war on eachother and then their allies got involved and started the first world war.   ","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, and explains how it could have caused tension between countries. However, the explanation is somewhat vague and lacks specific factual details. The student mentions the alliance between Russia, USA, and Britain, but this is incorrect as the USA was not part of the Triple Entente. The correct members were Russia, France, and Britain. The explanation of the impact on Germany is also not fully developed.

The student then shifts to discussing the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, providing a detailed narrative of the events leading to his death. While the narrative is accurate and detailed, it lacks a clear explanation of how this event led to the broader conflict of World War I. The student does mention that this caused countries to start declaring war on each other, but this explanation is not fully developed or linked back to the Alliance System.

Overall, the answer demonstrates some knowledge and understanding of the factors leading to World War I, but the explanations are not fully developed and lack coherence and structure. The student does not provide a sustained line of reasoning or a clear judgement.

This caused countries to start declaring war on eachother and then their allies got involved and started the first world war.   ","### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - **Spelling:** The answer contains a few spelling errors such as ""outstrengthened"" (which should be ""outnumbered"" or ""outmatched"") and ""eachother"" (which should be ""each other""). However, these errors are not frequent.
   - **Punctuation:** There are several punctuation issues, such as missing commas and periods. For example, ""Firstly as Russia, USA and Britain formed an alliance this could have caused Germany massive problems"" should have a comma after ""Firstly"" and ""alliance."" Additionally, ""The Duke was visiting Sarajevo, Bosnia. Serbia formed a group called the black hand which was a group of young men and they planned to assassinate Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand"" should have a comma after ""hand.""

2. **Grammar:**
   - The answer generally maintains control of meaning, but there are some grammatical issues. For example, ""as they have far less soldiers and supplies than the triple alliance had"" should be ""as they had far fewer soldiers and supplies than the Triple Alliance had.""
   - Another example is ""so he didn't drown and was then arrested,"" which could be more effectively written as ""so he did not drown and was then arrested.""

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The answer uses several specialist terms such as ""Alliance System,"" ""Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Sarajevo,"" ""Bosnia,"" ""Serbia,"" and ""the black hand."" However, the term ""triple alliance"" should be capitalized as ""Triple Alliance.""

### Final Assessment:

- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, but there are noticeable errors.
- **Grammar:** The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, and the errors do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student uses a good range of specialist terms, though there are minor issues with capitalization.

### Conclusion:

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student’s answer fits best into **Level 3**. The errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar are present but do not severely hinder the meaning. The use of specialist terms is good, but not wide-ranging enough to push it into Level 2.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Both Sources are useful to a historian. Source B is an image that was published in the British newspaper, October 1917. The image shows how Britain used creeping barrage and technology to fight the Germans. These new tactics worked very well for the Allies and stopped the stalemate. Planes are also shown in the picture and they were a brilliant piece of technology Britain used. The planes could see from above where the soldiers needed to attack and if there are any weak points. Source C is about Frank Mitchell's experience during the German Spring Offensive. He says his tank Was stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack his tank. On his right seven tanks turned up and sent the soldiers running in different directions. This shows us how effective tanks were in the first word war. In Source C he also says seven of our newest tanks. This tells us Britain has been making more tanks and will probably keep making progress like they did then. ","The student demonstrates an understanding of both sources and provides some analysis of their content. For Source B, the student identifies the use of ""creeping barrage"" and the role of planes, explaining their significance in breaking the stalemate. For Source C, the student describes Frank Mitchell's account of the effectiveness of tanks during the German Spring Offensive, highlighting the development and impact of new tank models.

However, the evaluation of the sources' utility is somewhat limited. The student does not fully explore the provenance of the sources or how this affects their usefulness to a historian. For example, the fact that Source B was published in a British newspaper during the war could be discussed in terms of its potential bias or propaganda value. Similarly, the firsthand nature of Source C, written by a tank commander who was awarded a medal for bravery, could be evaluated for its reliability and perspective.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources, and how these aspects contribute to their utility for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. Additionally, the student could benefit from integrating more contextual knowledge to support their analysis.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was an idea a German General created at the start of the first World War. He planned it would take Russia six weeks to prepare for war, so they quickly wanted to defeat France. When the Schlieffen plan was put into action Germany didn't want to fight France at the border as it was heavily fortified. Germany decided to invade Belgium up North then get to France. Belgium was neutral and no body expected Germany to do this. However Germany expected that Belgium would let them pass but they put up a good fight and slowed down the Germans. This gave Russia more time and France could get their troops up north. Soon after Germany invaded Belgium, Britain joined the war as they had an agreement. Britain joining the War was terrible for Germany as they were a strong nation with a big military. Russia also declared they where ready for war way quicker than Germany expected. Germany now had to fight Britian, France and Russia at the same time. That is how the Schieiffen Plan failed.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer identifies key elements of the plan, such as the expectation that Russia would take six weeks to mobilize and the decision to invade Belgium to bypass French fortifications. The student also explains how Belgium's resistance and Britain's entry into the war created problems for Germany, as well as Russia's quicker-than-expected mobilization.

This answer clearly moves beyond Level 1, where only general statements and basic knowledge are required. It fits into Level 2 as it presents a structured account with specific knowledge and understanding. The student shows a simple analysis of causation/consequence by explaining how the resistance in Belgium and the involvement of Britain and Russia led to the failure of the Schlieffen Plan.

To reach Level 3, the answer would need to demonstrate a developed analysis with more detailed sequencing and reasoning. For example, the student could have elaborated on how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a stalemate on the Western Front and the subsequent trench warfare.

","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, but does not provide a detailed explanation of how it contributed to the outbreak of the First World War. Instead, the response focuses on the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the resulting tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, as well as the involvement of Germany and Russia. This is relevant but lacks depth and specific knowledge about the Alliance System itself.

The second paragraph introduces the Moroccan Crisis as another factor contributing to the war. The student provides some context and explains the tensions between France and Germany, but the explanation is not fully developed and lacks specific details about the crisis and its impact on the broader European tensions.

Overall, the response demonstrates some knowledge and understanding of relevant factors but lacks the depth and detail required for higher levels.

A Conference took place in Algiers to decide who should have Morocco. Most Countries agreed France should take control and Germany was humiliated. The Kaiser was furious and tensions were rising between France and Germany. ","### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - **Spelling:**
     - ""assainated"" should be ""assassinated.""
     - ""word"" should be ""world.""
   - **Punctuation:**
     - The first sentence should have a period after ""extent.""
     - ""Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia"" should have a comma before ""however.""
     - ""Austria-Hungary asked Germany if they would back them up and Germany agreed to do so"" should have a comma before ""and.""
     - ""France wanted Control of Morocco"" should have ""control"" in lowercase.
     - ""A Conference took place in Algiers"" should have ""conference"" in lowercase.
     - ""Most Countries agreed"" should have ""countries"" in lowercase.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The overall control of meaning is generally maintained, but there are some grammatical issues:
     - ""Due to a Serbian group called 'Black Hand' the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Franz Ferdinand) was assassinated in Sarajevo"" could be clearer with a comma after ""Black Hand.""
     - ""This caused massive tension between Serbia and Austria-Hungary"" could be more precise with ""This caused massive tensions between Serbia and Austria-Hungary.""
     - ""Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia however Serbia was close allies with Russia and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia"" could be clearer with better punctuation and structure: ""Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia; however, Serbia was close allies with Russia, and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia.""
     - ""The German Kaiser wanted an Empire and so taking Morocco would be a good start"" could be clearer with: ""The German Kaiser wanted an empire, and so taking Morocco would be a good start.""

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The answer uses several specialist terms appropriately: ""Black Hand,"" ""heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne,"" ""Serbia,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" ""Germany,"" ""Russia,"" ""Moroccan Crisis,"" ""France,"" ""Britain,"" ""Kaiser,"" ""Empire,"" ""Conference,"" ""Algiers,"" ""Morocco.""

### Final Analysis:
- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though there are a few errors.
- **Grammar:** The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, though there are some areas that could be clearer.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student uses a good range of specialist terms as appropriate.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student demonstrates a performance that fits well within **Level 2**. The errors present do not significantly hinder the overall meaning, and the use of specialist terms is good.

1500 units","Let's evaluate the given answer based on the mark scheme provided.

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - The answer correctly substitutes the values into the formula:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - This part of the answer is correct and matches the mark scheme.

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The answer correctly calculates the decrease:
     \[
     4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - This part of the answer is also correct and matches the mark scheme.

3. **Workings:**
   - The workings provided in the answer are somewhat jumbled and include some unnecessary steps, but the key calculations are present and correct:
     - The initial break-even calculation for the new selling price:
       \[
       \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = 2,500 \text{ units}
       \]
     - The decrease in the break-even level of output:
       \[
       4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \text{ units}
       \]

Based on the mark scheme, the answer correctly shows the substitution into the formula and the calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output. Therefore, the answer should be awarded full marks.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""Financial information gives Amelia an idea on what she needs to spend money to begin the business and what she could use to improve the business's standards."" This outlines a general way financial information can help forecast success by indicating initial spending and potential improvements. However, it lacks specific financial tools or forecasts that could be used, such as cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis, which are mentioned in the mark scheme example answers.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are somewhat linked. The statement connects the idea of financial information to spending and improvement, but it does not provide a clear, specific link to how this information will forecast success. The answer could be more explicit in linking financial information to specific outcomes or forecasts.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Given that the points are not strongly linked and the answer lacks specific financial tools or forecasts, it does not fully meet the criteria for linked points. Therefore, it should be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).
  - As a result, she would be determined to succeed as there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. This could give her an extra incentive to do well. (AO3a).
  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

This may keep her motivated because she is working what she wants to do. This leads to an increase in motivation which allows her to make more money as she feels she can do more plumbings. 

Another non-financial aim of Amelia's choice could be independence. Being independent allows her to work her own working hours and may allow her to be creative with it as she has no boss. This may increase productivity as she can work whenever she feels like it. This also will lead to her feeling more motivated to work.","The candidate identifies two non-financial aims: personal satisfaction and independence. 

1. **Personal Satisfaction:**
   - The candidate states that personal satisfaction may keep Amelia motivated because she is working in a field she enjoys. This is developed through the idea that increased motivation allows her to make more money as she feels she can do more plumbing work. However, the explanation lacks depth and logical consistency, as it does not clearly connect how personal satisfaction directly leads to increased earnings.

2. **Independence:**
   - The candidate mentions that independence allows Amelia to work her own hours and be creative, as she has no boss. This is developed through the idea that increased productivity results from working whenever she feels like it, leading to more motivation to work. This point is more logically consistent but still lacks detailed reasoning and connection to the broader business context.

**Application (AO2):**
- The response shows some application of business concepts to the context of Amelia starting her own plumbing business. Terms like ""personal satisfaction,"" ""independence,"" and ""working hours"" are relevant but not deeply contextualized to Amelia's specific situation in Birmingham or the plumbing industry.

**Analysis (AO3a):**
- The response attempts to deconstruct the impact of non-financial aims but does so with limited connections between points. The chains of reasoning are not fully developed, and there are logical inconsistencies, particularly in the explanation of how personal satisfaction leads to increased earnings.

**Level Determination:**
- The response fits the criteria for Level 1, as it shows limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the business context and attempts to deconstruct business information with limited connections between points.

1. **First Impact:**
   - The candidate states that secondary research is ""cheap or free,"" which is a valid point. This is developed through ""she doesn't have to use much money to understand her market,"" which is further developed by stating that this allows her to ""know what the market is like and what to do to prepare."" The candidate concludes this chain of reasoning with ""This can lead to an increase in business survival as she is more organised, with her resources."" This shows a logical chain of reasoning, although it could be more detailed.

   - The candidate mentions that secondary research ""can be out of date as it is published on the internet whilst the market is changing frequently."" This is developed through ""This data she collects could be misleading which affects her understanding of her customers."" The candidate concludes this point with ""This may lead to business failure as she wouldn't have prepared correctly.""

**Application (AO2):**
- The response shows some application of knowledge to the business context, mentioning that secondary research is cheap or free and that it can be out of date. However, the application is somewhat generic and lacks specific details related to Lili Heating Ltd or Amelia's unique situation.

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The Answer states: ""place is another element of the marketing mix.""

**Marking Criteria:**
- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful.**
  - The candidate states, ""If Lili Heating LTD is successful, this may decrease the amount of houses needing plumbing around Birmingham."" This point is somewhat relevant but not directly linked to why the government would want the business to be successful. The improvement in the mood of citizens is mentioned, but it is not a strong or direct reason for government interest. The response lacks a clear link to government benefits such as tax revenue or employment, which are more compelling reasons as per the example answers.
  
- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.**
  - The points provided are not well-linked. The statement about improving the mood of citizens is not directly connected to a clear government objective like tax collection or employment. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied.

**Example Answers:**
- The example answers provide clear and direct reasons such as increased tax revenue or employment, which are strong and relevant points. The candidate's answer does not align well with these examples.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","I have chosen option 1.
If she offers a discounted price to female customers, more females will feel inclined to pay for her service as she is offering an exclusive deal to a specific group of people. This may lead Amelia's business to have a higher share in the market which can increase profit.

However, this idea seems wrong, as it is unfair to male customers. If this decision is made, a large proportion of male customers will be attracted to other plumbing businesses in the market. This may lead to an increase in competition in the market that Amelia may not be able to handle.

It also may reduce the reputation of her business and make it seem unacceptable. A decrease in reputation can lead to less customers willing to pay for their service which ultimately ends the business with failure. To conclude, Amelia may face many problems with this choice but it is still a high risk high reward choice. Since it's a Ltd, she won't lose any personal assets meaning she can take more risks.","The candidate begins by stating that they have chosen Option 1, which is to offer a discounted price to female customers. They provide some reasoning for this choice, suggesting that it will attract more female customers and potentially increase market share and profit. This demonstrates some application of business concepts to the context (AO2), but it is not detailed enough to be considered thorough.

The candidate then discusses the potential drawbacks of this option, such as it being unfair to male customers and possibly leading to increased competition and a damaged reputation. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but the points are not fully developed or interconnected.

The final paragraph attempts to conclude by weighing the risks and rewards, mentioning that as a limited company (Ltd), Amelia won't lose personal assets, which allows for more risk-taking. This shows some understanding of business structure and risk management, but the overall evaluation remains limited and lacks depth.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the business scenario and provides some interconnected points, but the analysis and evaluation are not detailed or thorough. Therefore, this answer should be placed in Level 2.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","the energy may not be reliable as the windmills depend on wind which is different at different times of the day.
","Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria

#### Stating one risk for investors in Ripple

- **Criteria:** Stating one risk for investors in Ripple.
- **Example Answers:** 
  - Loss of money invested in the wind farm (1)
  - Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs (1)
  - Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy (1)

### Evaluation

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""the energy may not be reliable as the windmills depend on wind which is different at different times of the day.""
   - This statement identifies a risk related to the reliability of energy production due to the variability of wind, which is a valid concern for investors in a wind farm.
   - The risk mentioned aligns with the example answer ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs,"" as unreliable wind could lead to insufficient energy production.

### Conclusion

The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple by pointing out the potential unreliability of energy production due to the variability of wind. This is a valid risk and is supported by the context of Ripple being a wind farm dependent on wind conditions.

This will keep the customers satisfied.","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""If Ripple understands their customer needs, they can set their business and offer the customers what they need."" This implies a benefit to customers as Ripple will tailor their services to meet customer needs, which is a valid point. However, the benefit is not explicitly clear or specific to the context of Ripple's green energy plans. The mark scheme example answers provide specific benefits such as receiving the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs. The answer does not clearly outline a specific benefit to the customers of Ripple, so this criterion is not fully satisfied.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer continues with, ""This will keep the customers satisfied."" This provides some development by explaining the outcome of Ripple understanding customer needs. However, the development is generic and lacks specific application to Ripple's context of providing green energy plans or investment returns. The mark scheme requires linked development with evidence of application, such as ensuring customers receive the correct amount of energy or the best return on their investment. The answer does not provide sufficient linked development or specific application to Ripple's context, so this criterion is not fully satisfied.

Overall, the answer provides a general benefit but lacks specific context and detailed development. Therefore, it should be awarded 1 mark.

    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

People may like this idea and want to pay for their services leading to profit made.

It is also beneficial for Ripple as they can spend this money on primary research. Having primary data allows Ripple to have a deeper understanding of customers and the market. They can use this data to improve their business as a whole which leads to an increase for survival.

However, other small businesses like Ripple pay less tax meaning other small companies in this market can benefit from this by improving their business with this money. This leads to an increase in competition between competitors which may be too overwhelming for Ripple to handle.

To conclude, Ripple has its own USP as it uses renewable energy that doesn't harm the environment. If they use the extra money wisely, they can come out more successful than the rest of the market.","The candidate begins by stating that they have chosen Option 1, which is a clear indication of their judgment. They provide some application (AO2) by discussing how Ripple can use the extra money to create more windmills and conduct primary research. This shows a sound understanding of the business context, but the application is not detailed enough to be placed in Level 3.

The analysis (AO3a) is present but somewhat limited. The candidate mentions that spending money on primary research can help Ripple understand customers and the market better, which can lead to business improvement and increased chances of survival. However, the chains of reasoning are not fully developed, and there are some logical inconsistencies, such as the vague connection between primary research and business survival.

The evaluation (AO3b) is also present but limited. The candidate acknowledges the potential increase in competition due to other small businesses benefiting from paying less tax. They conclude by stating that Ripple's unique selling proposition (USP) of using renewable energy can help it succeed if the extra money is used wisely. However, the evaluation lacks depth and thoroughness.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","The place of where there windmills are important as it is located in a remote area of South Wales. This means the customers can receive energy elsewhere and not be disturbed by the large windmills. This opportunity seems desirable as the members won't be disturbed and they feel that they are improving the environment.

The method of the customers being promoted to members of the business is very simple. This makes it more convenient for the people which is also a customer's need. Making promotion more convenient for customers allows Ripple to add value to their service meaning they can increase profit which leads to further future success in the business.

This is very important as 

The way Ripple produces their energy is through renewable energy. As it mentions, it doesn't harm the environment but keeps it a healthier place. This is important because it stands out as their USP. Having a USP makes their business stand out amongst the market, which will attract customers. They can increase members paying for their service which leads to an increase in revenue. This increase in revenue is important as they can use the extra money on further development for the business.

Ripple is flexible with the way the price of their energy plans are set at. The amount of money customers can invest varies on their energy needs. This Is beneficial to the customers as they won't need to pay a fixed price where they could be wasting money. Also, Ripple claims their services are cheaper than other competitors. This will attract customers because customers aim to find the best value for their money. Ripple's pricing is crucial as it gives the customers a choice. This will lead to an increase in members because of the vast options they offer.
To conclude, Ripple's marketing mix helps form the type of business that they are. It will definitely help them in the survival of their business
","The candidate's response covers several aspects of Ripple's marketing mix, but it lacks focus on the importance of price specifically. The response is structured into multiple paragraphs, each addressing different elements of the marketing mix, such as place, promotion, product, and price. However, the question specifically asks for an evaluation of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix.

1. **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b):**
   - The candidate demonstrates some knowledge of business concepts and issues, such as the importance of location, convenience, and unique selling propositions (USPs). However, the use of business terminology is limited and not always accurate. For example, the term ""promotion"" is used incorrectly to describe the process of becoming a member.

2. **Application (AO2):**
   - The application of knowledge to the business context is present but inconsistent. The candidate mentions the remote location of the wind farm in South Wales and the simplicity of becoming a member, which are relevant to Ripple. However, the response does not consistently apply these points to the importance of price in the marketing mix.

3. **Analysis (AO3a):**
   - The candidate attempts to deconstruct business information and issues but finds limited connections between points. The analysis is fragmented and lacks logical chains of reasoning. For example, the discussion on the USP and renewable energy is not clearly linked to the importance of price.

4. **Evaluation (AO3b):**
   - The candidate makes some judgments but provides simple justifications based on limited evaluation. The conclusion is generic and does not specifically address the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. The response lacks a thorough evaluation of how price impacts Ripple's business strategy and customer attraction.

**Overall Level and Mark:**
- The response fits best in Level 1 due to limited application, fragmented analysis, and simple evaluation. The candidate demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding but does not effectively address the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix.
- Awarded Marks: 3

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Focus more on the specific aspect of price and its importance in Ripple's marketing mix.
- Use accurate business terminology and provide detailed application to the business context.
- Develop logical chains of reasoning and interconnected points to strengthen the analysis.
- Provide a well-reasoned conclusion based on a thorough evaluation of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix.",3,3,12,1.0,1.0,True,1.0,0.0,,,,,6.5693018436431885,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 5994, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.02997, 'completion_tokens': 479, 'completion_cost': 0.007185, 'total_cost': 0.037155}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 517, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.002585, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.0026}"

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate states, ""An advantage of starting a business as a private limited company is you research primary data."" This does not directly identify an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The mark scheme examples include advantages such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not met. **0 marks**

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The candidate continues with, ""meaning you collect it for your business and have your own strategies.""

The candidate's response needs to identify a way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate and provide an explanation of that way.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate states, ""The internet may affect location of a business because it might not always be accurate."" This does not clearly identify a specific way the internet affects the location choice of a business. The mark scheme examples include ways such as choosing a cheaper location due to e-commerce or needing a location with good internet connections. The candidate's response does not align with these examples or provide a clear alternative way. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain by stating, ""for example you can look at a site but that image might be years old so that location might not be suitable anymore."" This explanation is not directly related to how the internet affects the choice of location for a business. Instead, it discusses the potential inaccuracy of online images, which is not relevant to the core question of how the internet influences location decisions. The mark scheme examples focus on aspects like e-commerce reducing the need for a physical location or the necessity of good internet connections for communication. The candidate's explanation does not align with these examples or provide a relevant alternative explanation. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

Answer: 1,500 units (1)",,"£10 000/(£5 - £2.50) = £1997.50
£10000/(£6.50 - 2.50) = 1536
1997.50 - 1536 = 461
£461","To grade the provided answer, let's break down the steps and compare them to the mark scheme.

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Cost per Unit}}
     \]
   - For the original selling price of £5.00:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£5.00 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£2.50} = 4,000 \text{ units}
     \]
   - For the new selling price of £6.50:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The decrease is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's evaluate the given answer:

- The first calculation:
  \[
  £10,000 / (£5 - £2.50) = £1997.50
  \]
  This is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:
  \[
  £10,000 / £2.50 = 4,000 \text{ units}
  \]

- The second calculation:
  \[
  £10,000 / (£6.50 - £2.50) = 1536
  \]
  This is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:
  \[
  £10,000 / £4.00 = 2,500 \text{ units}
  \]

- The final calculation:
  \[
  1997.50 - 1536 = 461
  \]
  This is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:
  \[
  4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \text{ units}
  \]

- The final answer given is £461, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 1,500 units.

**Marking:**

- The student did not correctly substitute into the formula for either the original or the new selling price.
- The student did not correctly calculate the decrease in the break-even level of output.
- No correct intermediate steps were shown.

The candidate has suggested a disadvantage through ""The employees may become untrustworthy towards the manager"" and this is developed through ""the employees might not then have the money for personal things like food or showers"". The candidate then further develops their answer by explaining the consequence: ""meaning they come into work with low energy and be disrespectful to customers which could lead to them not returning"". 

Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate identifies a disadvantage: ""The employees may become untrustworthy towards the manager"". This satisfies the first marking criterion. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate explains the disadvantage by stating that employees might not have money for personal necessities: ""the employees might not then have the money for personal things like food or showers"". This is a valid explanation and aligns with the example answers where the impact on employees' personal lives is considered. **(1 mark)**
  - The candidate further develops the explanation by linking it to the business impact: ""meaning they come into work with low energy and be disrespectful to customers which could lead to them not returning"". This is a clear and logical consequence of the initial disadvantage, similar to the example answer where employee dissatisfaction leads to business problems. **(1 mark)**

Overall, the candidate's response is well-developed and stays focused on the question. The answer should be awarded the full 3 marks.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer does not clearly identify an advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. The statement ""it means they save the profit they have made"" is more of a description rather than an explicit advantage. Therefore, this criterion is not met. (0 marks)

- **Explaining the advantage:**
  - The explanation provided is that ""the business could later use this money later in the business to maybe pay back a loan or upgrade products and quality.""

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""Financial information could help the business as it can forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft."" This outlines a way financial information could help forecast success, but it lacks specific details or examples. The response does not mention specific financial tools or methods such as cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis, which are crucial for a complete answer. Therefore, this criterion is partially met.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are not sufficiently linked. The response mentions forecasting potential success and the need for an overdraft, but it does not explain how these are connected or provide a detailed example. For instance, it does not explain how a cash-flow forecast or break-even analysis would help in determining the need for an overdraft. Thus, this criterion is not fully satisfied.

","Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states, ""Another element of the marketing mix is products."" This correctly identifies ""product"" as an element of the marketing mix. Therefore, it satisfies this criterion.

### Application of Context

- The mark scheme requires evidence of application to award 1 mark. The answer should ideally relate the element of the marketing mix to Lili Heating Ltd. For example, it could mention that the product involves repairing or installing boilers, as indicated in the example answers.

### Example Answers Comparison

- The example answer ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1 mark) provides a specific application to Lili Heating Ltd.
- The given answer, ""Another element of the marketing mix is products,"" lacks this specific application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Conclusion

- The answer correctly identifies ""product"" as an element of the marketing mix, but it does not provide specific application to Lili Heating Ltd as required by the mark scheme.

### Final Mark

- **0 marks**: The answer does not fully meet the criteria for application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

They mention that promoting the business on social media is low cost and can lead to increased recognition and sales, which can be reinvested into improving product quality. This demonstrates a sound application of business concepts and understanding of the business context (AO2), placing it in Level 2.

The candidate also considers the drawbacks of option 1, suggesting that offering discounts to women might offend men and result in negative reviews, which could harm the business's reputation and sales.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""the business will understand more what customers want and can then provide that."" This is a valid point as it indicates that Ripple will be able to tailor its services to meet customer needs. However, the benefit to the customer is not explicitly clear in terms of how it directly impacts them. The mark scheme example answers focus on specific benefits such as receiving the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs. The answer does not clearly articulate a direct benefit to the customer in this manner. Therefore, this point is not fully satisfied.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer attempts to link the understanding of customer needs to increased sales for the business, stating, ""Therefor leading to more sales."" However, this is more of a benefit to the business rather than the customer. The mark scheme requires the benefit to be customer-focused, such as ensuring they receive the correct amount of energy or the best return on their investment. The answer does not provide sufficient linked development that directly benefits the customer. Therefore, this point is not fully satisfied.

- **Contextualization:**
  - The answer does not provide specific context related to Ripple or its unique business model of consumer-owned wind farms. The context provided in the mark scheme includes details about Ripple's green energy plans and investment strategies, which are not mentioned in the answer. Therefore, this point is not satisfied.

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",Price is very important in Ripples as they need to become members of the business before they can be supplied with energy. This means the business owners can have a more intimate relationship with their customers so they are loyal and keep coming back which can gain them more money. This method is also more trustworthy for the customers so they can feel they are part of a community.,"The candidate begins by discussing the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix, but the response is quite limited in scope. The candidate mentions that customers need to become members before they can be supplied with energy, which is a relevant point. However, the explanation lacks depth and does not fully explore the implications of price on Ripple's business model.

The candidate touches on the idea of building a relationship with customers and fostering loyalty, which is a valid point. However, this point is not sufficiently developed or linked back to the importance of price in the marketing mix. The response also lacks specific business terminology and detailed application to the context of Ripple.

There is an attempt to deconstruct the business information, but the connections between points are limited and not well-developed. The conclusion is very brief and does not provide a thorough evaluation of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix.

Overall, the response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts but lacks depth and detailed application to the business context. The evaluation is limited and does not provide a well-reasoned conclusion.

Based on the mark scheme, this response fits into Level 1. The candidate demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts with limited business terminology used (AO1b). There is limited application of knowledge and understanding to the business context (AO2). The attempt to deconstruct business information and issues is limited, and the conclusion is supported by generic assertions from limited evaluation (AO3a and AO3b).

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Sources B and C are very useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics. For example, Source B shows a new tactic developed in the war called a creeping barrage this is when artillery from very far behind shoot in front of their own men and the explosions give cover and make it easy for them to advance toward enemy trenches. Australia were very known for using this tactic and were very good at it, they would get really close to the artillery fire and advance very quickly. Source C is also useful to a historian as it is written by a tank commander which means it very reliable, another reason why source C is helpful is it showcases a newly developed weapon and illustrates how significant it was in the first world war. The source tells a short story on Frank Mitchell and how he was stuck bound to be attacked when seven of their newest, fastest tanks raced past called 'wippets'. The source also says about the tanks machine guns which had also been worked on alot during the first world war, the original machine gun the 'vickers gun' was very heavy so was mostly used stationary with a crew of six men operating it the new machine gun the lewis gun was much lighter and very easy to be operated by 1-2 men and was the first development of the assault rifle. ","The student demonstrates a good understanding of both sources and provides some contextual knowledge to support their analysis. They identify relevant features of Source B, such as the depiction of the creeping barrage tactic, and explain its significance in the context of the First World War. The mention of Australia's proficiency with this tactic adds depth to the analysis. 

For Source C, the student highlights the reliability of the source due to its author being a tank commander and provides a detailed account of the new 'Whippet' tanks and their impact on the battlefield. The student also discusses the development of machine guns, comparing the Vickers gun and the Lewis gun, which adds further context to the analysis.

However, the evaluation of the provenance of Source B is missing, and the evaluation of Source C's provenance could be more developed. The student should also explicitly link the content and provenance to the utility of the sources for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

Overall, the answer shows developed evaluation of the content of both sources and some contextual knowledge, placing it in Level 3. To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of both sources, including a more detailed analysis of the provenance and its impact on the utility of the sources.

The Franco-Prussian Alliance was the first of many between France and Russia, along with the Dual Alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary these were the base alliances and when Italy joined the Dual Alliance to make it the Triple Alliance, Britain decided to join the Franco-Prussian Alliance to make it the Triple Alliance. Alliances could be a big cause of war because when two nations have a problem it makes it very easy for others to get dragged in this could then cause a large scale war this happened many times during the build up to World War One when a country has taken some land of someone elses and they wanted it back so other nations had to help. ","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, and provides a basic explanation of the alliances formed between European nations. They mention the Franco-Prussian Alliance, the Dual Alliance, and the formation of the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente. However, the explanation lacks depth and specific factual knowledge. The student does not provide detailed information about the motives and rivalries that led to the formation of these alliances or how they contributed to the outbreak of the war.

The student does make a relevant point about how alliances could lead to a larger scale war by dragging other nations into conflicts, but this point is not developed or substantiated with specific examples or detailed reasoning.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to provide a more detailed explanation of the stated factor, including specific knowledge and understanding of the alliances and their impact on the tensions in Europe. Additionally, the student should explain other factors that contributed to the outbreak of the war to provide a more balanced and comprehensive answer.

The Franco-Prussian Alliance was the first of many between France and Russia, along with the Dual Alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary these were the base alliances and when Italy joined the Dual Alliance to make it the Triple Alliance, Britain decided to join the Franco-Prussian Alliance to make it the Triple Alliance.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer step-by-step:

### Spelling and Punctuation
- **Spelling**: The student spells most words correctly. However, there are a few errors:
  - ""european"" should be capitalized as ""European.""
  - ""Franco-Prussian Alliance"" is incorrect; it should be ""Franco-Russian Alliance.""
  - ""someone elses"" should be ""someone else's.""
- **Punctuation**: The student uses punctuation inconsistently:
  - The sentence ""I somewhat agree with this statement, every european nation aligns itself with another to increase security."" should be split into two sentences or use a semicolon.
  - The sentence ""The Franco-Prussian Alliance was the first of many between France and Russia, along with the Dual Alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary these were the base alliances and when Italy joined the Dual Alliance to make it the Triple Alliance, Britain decided to join the Franco-Prussian Alliance to make it the Triple Alliance."" is a run-on sentence and should be broken down for clarity.
  - The sentence ""Alliances could be a big cause of war because when two nations have a problem it makes it very easy for others to get dragged in this could then cause a large scale war this happened many times during the build up to World War One when a country has taken some land of someone elses and they wanted it back so other nations had to help."" is also a run-on sentence and needs proper punctuation.

### Grammar
- The student generally uses grammar correctly but with some lapses:
  - The sentence structure is often complex and could be simplified for better clarity.
  - The use of ""this happened many times during the build up to World War One"" is somewhat vague and could be more specific.

### Use of Specialist Terms
- The student uses several specialist terms related to the topic:
  - ""Franco-Prussian Alliance"" (though incorrectly named, the intent is clear)
  - ""Dual Alliance""
  - ""Triple Alliance""
  - ""World War One""

### Overall Assessment
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: The student spells with reasonable accuracy but has some errors. Punctuation is inconsistent and affects readability.
- **Grammar**: The student uses grammar with some control of meaning, but errors do not significantly hinder understanding.
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses a limited range of specialist terms, some of which are incorrectly named but still recognizable.

### Conclusion
Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best in **Level 3**:
- The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy.
- The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, and errors do not significantly hinder meaning overall.
- The student uses a limited range of specialist terms as appropriate.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Both Sources are useful to a historian. Source B is an image that was published in the British newspaper, October 1917. The image shows how Britain used creeping barrage and technology to fight the Germans. These new tactics worked very well for the Allies and stopped the stalemate. Planes are also shown in the picture and they were a brilliant piece of technology Britain used. The planes could see from above where the soldiers needed to attack and if there are any weak points. Source C is about Frank Mitchell's experience during the German Spring Offensive. He says his tank Was stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack his tank. On his right seven tanks turned up and sent the soldiers running in different directions. This shows us how effective tanks were in the first word war. In Source C he also says seven of our newest tanks. This tells us Britain has been making more tanks and will probably keep making progress like they did then. ","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student notes the use of creeping barrage and planes, and for Source C, they highlight the effectiveness of tanks and the development of new models. However, the evaluation is quite simple and lacks depth. The student does not provide much contextual knowledge or detailed reasoning related to the utility of the sources. Additionally, the provenance of the sources is not evaluated in a developed way.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to include more specific factual knowledge, provide extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources, and evaluate the provenance more thoroughly. For example, they could discuss the significance of the date of Source B and how it reflects the changing tactics and technology in the later years of the war. They could also evaluate the reliability of Source C, considering that it is a first-hand account from a decorated tank commander.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was an idea a German General created at the start of the first World War. He planned it would take Russia six weeks to prepare for war, so they quickly wanted to defeat France. When the Schlieffen plan was put into action Germany didn't want to fight France at the border as it was heavily fortified. Germany decided to invade Belgium up North then get to France. Belgium was neutral and no body expected Germany to do this. However Germany expected that Belgium would let them pass but they put up a good fight and slowed down the Germans. This gave Russia more time and France could get their troops up north. Soon after Germany invaded Belgium, Britain joined the war as they had an agreement. Britain joining the War was terrible for Germany as they were a strong nation with a big military. Russia also declared they where ready for war way quicker than Germany expected. Germany now had to fight Britian, France and Russia at the same time. That is how the Schieiffen Plan failed.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond basic statements to a more detailed narrative. The answer includes specific knowledge, such as the plan's reliance on Russia taking six weeks to mobilize, the invasion of Belgium, and the unexpected resistance from Belgium. The student also mentions the involvement of Britain and the quicker-than-expected mobilization of Russia, which are relevant points.

However, the analysis remains relatively simple and does not fully develop the consequences of these events. The answer lacks the depth and complexity required for higher levels, such as detailed reasoning about how these events led to a stalemate or increased tension. The student does not fully explain the broader implications of the Schlieffen Plan's failure, such as the resulting trench warfare and prolonged conflict on the Western Front.

    - N/A",,"I agree with this statement To some extent. Due to a Serbian group called 'Black Hand' the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Franz Ferdinand) was assainated in Sarajevo. This caused massive tension between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia however Serbia was close allies with Russia and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia. Austria-Hungary asked Germany if they would back them up and Germany agreed to do so. This caused tension between Germany and Russia.

The Moroccan Crisis had a big effect on why the first word war began. France wanted Control of Morocco and with Britain and France being allies, Britain encouraged France to do so. The German Kaiser wanted an Empire and so taking Morocco would be a good start. He believed Germany should have Morocco and he even visited it. A Conference took place in Algiers to decide who should have Morocco. Most Countries agreed France should take control and Germany was humiliated. The Kaiser was furious and tensions were rising between France and Germany.   
","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, and provides a basic explanation of the events leading up to the First World War, such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the subsequent tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge, which limits it to a basic level of reasoning.

The second paragraph introduces the Moroccan Crisis as another factor contributing to the outbreak of the First World War. The student explains the rivalry between France and Germany over Morocco and how this increased tensions. While this is relevant, the explanation remains simple and does not delve into the complexities of the situation or its broader implications.

Overall, the answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding of the factors leading to the First World War but lacks the detailed factual knowledge and complex reasoning required for higher levels. The student does not provide a sustained line of reasoning or a coherent structure that links the factors together to form a comprehensive argument.

To improve, the student should:
1. Provide more detailed factual knowledge and understanding of the events and their implications.
2. Develop a sustained line of reasoning that links the factors together.
3. Offer a more complex explanation of the relationship between the causes and how they contributed to the outbreak of the war.

A Conference took place in Algiers to decide who should have Morocco. Most Countries agreed France should take control and Germany was humiliated. The Kaiser was furious and tensions were rising between France and Germany.   
","### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - **Spelling:**
     - ""assainated"" should be ""assassinated.""
     - ""word"" should be ""world.""
   - **Punctuation:**
     - The first sentence should have a period after ""extent.""
     - ""Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia"" should be ""Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia.""
     - ""Austria-Hungary asked Germany if they would back them up and Germany agreed to do so"" should be ""Austria-Hungary asked Germany if they would back them up, and Germany agreed to do so.""
     - ""France wanted Control of Morocco"" should be ""France wanted control of Morocco.""
     - ""The German Kaiser wanted an Empire"" should be ""The German Kaiser wanted an empire.""
     - ""A Conference took place in Algiers"" should be ""A conference took place in Algiers.""

2. **Grammar:**
   - The use of grammar is generally good, but there are a few areas where it could be improved:
     - ""Due to a Serbian group called 'Black Hand' the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Franz Ferdinand) was assassinated in Sarajevo."" could be rephrased for clarity: ""Due to the actions of a Serbian group called 'Black Hand,' the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated in Sarajevo.""
     - ""This caused massive tension between Serbia and Austria-Hungary"" could be more precise: ""This assassination caused massive tension between Serbia and Austria-Hungary.""
     - ""Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia however Serbia was close allies with Russia and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia"" could be split into two sentences for clarity: ""Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia. However, Serbia was close allies with Russia, and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia.""
     - ""The German Kaiser wanted an Empire and so taking Morocco would be a good start"" could be rephrased: ""The German Kaiser wanted an empire, and he believed that taking Morocco would be a good start.""

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The answer uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Black Hand,"" ""heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne,"" ""Serbia,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" ""Germany,"" ""Russia,"" ""Moroccan Crisis,"" ""Britain,"" ""France,"" ""German Kaiser,"" ""Empire,"" and ""Algiers.""

### Final Assessment:

- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though there are a few errors.
- **Grammar:** The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall. The meaning is clear despite some minor grammatical issues.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student demonstrates a performance that fits well within **Level 2**. The errors present do not significantly hinder the overall meaning, and the use of specialist terms is good.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows a attacking technique known as the creeping barrage. Source C is a account from a veteran who fought in spring offensive. These sources are useful for a historian. Source C talks about whippets a new tank. In 1916, when tanks were first used they struggled to break enemy lines. Within 2 years they were able to move quickly into enemy lines. I believe the usage of tanks in the spring offensive was a key reason germany specialised unit, storm troopers, even after artillery fire and mustard gas.

Source B is a propaganda news article showing a new attack the creeping barrage. It was used in Verdun to break the stalemate by providing covers for soldiers. It demonstrates how accurate artillery fire had become and how well timed the army had become. However due to it being British propaganda it hides the issues from the public. For example if any of the timing were of by even a second it could lead to men dieng by there own artillery this happened and hundreds died. Both sources are usefull but they hide the issues with new technology because of the government controll over media in war. ","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some contextual knowledge to support their analysis. For Source B, they mention the ""creeping barrage"" and explain its purpose in breaking the stalemate, showing understanding of the tactic. They also acknowledge the source's nature as propaganda, which is a good start towards evaluating its provenance. However, the evaluation of the provenance could be more developed, as it only briefly mentions the potential issues with propaganda.

For Source C, the student identifies the use of ""Whippet"" tanks and provides some contextual knowledge about the development of tanks from 1916 to 1918. They also mention the German Spring Offensive and the role of tanks in countering the German stormtroopers. This shows a good understanding of the content and some contextual knowledge, but the evaluation of the provenance is lacking. The student does not fully explore the significance of the source being a first-hand account from a decorated tank commander.

To reach level 3, the student would need to provide more extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources, particularly focusing on the provenance. For example, they could discuss how the first-hand account in Source C provides a more personal and potentially reliable perspective on the effectiveness of tanks, while also considering any potential biases due to the author's involvement in the events.

Overall, the answer falls into level 2 due to the simple evaluation of the content and some contextual knowledge. To improve, the student should develop their evaluation of the provenance and provide more detailed reasoning related to the utility of the sources.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was a plan to capture paris within 7 weeks so that by the time Russia had mobilised they would only have to fight on one front. However the plan failed due to Belgium resistance and Russia mobilising its army in 15 days.

The first issue this caused was a war on two front west France, east Russia. This meant that Germany was spread thin on supply meaning the soldiers began to starve as they couldn't transport food to 2 fronts. For survival the Germans began to dig trenches so the British and the French did too.

This was the second issue the creation of trenches led to a stalemate. During this thousands of men died but no land was taken due to periods of heavy artillery fire. In addition the trenches condition caused issues as disease spread fast so hundreds died due to a lack of hygiene for example trench foot from the muddy floor and cholera was spread due to flees bitting the infected and spreading it.","The student's answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving it beyond Level 1. The answer is structured and shows specific knowledge relevant to the question, such as the plan's aim to capture Paris within 7 weeks and the issues caused by Belgian resistance and Russia's rapid mobilization. This places the answer in Level 2.

The student identifies two main problems caused by the failure of the Schlieffen Plan: the war on two fronts and the creation of trenches leading to a stalemate. These points are supported with factual knowledge, such as the spread of disease in the trenches and the impact of heavy artillery fire. However, the analysis remains relatively simple and lacks the developed sequencing and reasoning required for Level 3.

To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide a more developed analysis of how these problems specifically affected the course of the war and increased tension. For example, they could explain how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a prolonged and grueling conflict on the Western Front, or how the stalemate in the trenches impacted military strategies and the overall morale of the troops.

For example, countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England began to worry and they began forming alliances with the entene cordial in 1904 with France and England and the triple extent in 1906 with France England and Russia. This ment if any country went to war they would all get dragged in.

The alliances also escalated the balkans crisis into major war as Austria Hungary had been given a blanc check by Germany as they had full suport. It also created tension between Russia (not wanting to look weak) and Germany. Due to Russias pride they refused to step down to Germany. France a russian aly began preparing for war due to Russides actions. Austria would use German engineering to bomb belgrade this was the first bombing of WW1. 

The Alliance caused conflict as other countries wanting to join for example Serbia and Bosnia turned to unite with Russia as they were Slavic Brothers. Bosnia had a revolution against Austria where Arche duke frans ferdinand was assasinated because they wanted to escape Austria's controll and join russia. This led to the to point ultimatum which would be the reason war broke out. Due to the alliance all the countries were dragged in even ones who did nothing in the Balkans crisis.

There would have been less conflict if alliances weren't made.
","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, and provides some relevant points. They mention the formation of alliances such as the Entente Cordiale and the Triple Entente, and how these alliances meant that if one country went to war, others would be dragged in. This shows a basic understanding of the Alliance System and its implications, but the explanation lacks depth and specific factual knowledge.

In the second paragraph, the student discusses the Balkans crisis and the ""blank check"" given by Germany to Austria-Hungary. They mention the tension between Russia and Germany and the involvement of France due to its alliance with Russia. This paragraph shows some understanding of the events leading up to the war, but the explanation is somewhat disjointed and lacks coherence. The mention of ""German engineering to bomb Belgrade"" is not entirely accurate and could be clarified.

The third paragraph touches on the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the involvement of Serbia and Bosnia. The student correctly identifies the assassination as a significant event, but the explanation is again somewhat fragmented. The mention of the ""two-point ultimatum"" is unclear and should be elaborated upon.

Overall, the student demonstrates a basic understanding of the Alliance System and its role in escalating the conflict, but the explanation lacks coherence, depth, and specific factual knowledge. The answer falls into Level 2 due to the simple explanation of the stated factor and other factors, but it does not reach Level 3 due to the lack of developed reasoning and detailed knowledge.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer step-by-step:

### Spelling and Punctuation
- **Consistent Accuracy**: The answer contains several spelling errors such as ""entene"" (should be ""Entente""), ""extent"" (should be ""Entente""), ""ment"" (should be ""meant""), ""blanc"" (should be ""blank""), ""suport"" (should be ""support""), ""aly"" (should be ""ally""), ""Russides"" (should be ""Russia's""), ""Arche duke frans ferdinand"" (should be ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand""), ""assasinated"" (should be ""assassinated""), ""controll"" (should be ""control""), and ""to point ultimatum"" (should be ""two-point ultimatum"").
- **Considerable Accuracy**: Despite the errors, the majority of the text is spelled correctly, and the punctuation is generally correct, though there are some missing commas and periods that could improve readability.
- **Reasonable Accuracy**: The errors do not significantly hinder the meaning overall, but they are frequent enough to be noticeable.

### Grammar
- **Effective Control**: The grammar is not consistently accurate. There are several instances where sentence structure could be improved for clarity, such as ""countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England began to worry"" (should be ""countries that didn’t intervene in European affairs, like England, began to worry"").
- **General Control**: The student generally conveys their points clearly, but there are grammatical errors that affect the flow and clarity of the text.
- **Some Control**: The errors in grammar do not significantly hinder the overall meaning, but they are present and noticeable.

### Use of Specialist Terms
- **Wide Range**: The student uses several specialist terms such as ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""Triple Entente,"" ""Balkans crisis,"" ""blank check,"" ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" and ""two-point ultimatum.""
- **Good Range**: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and uses relevant terms appropriately.
- **Limited Range**: The student uses a variety of specialist terms, but there are some inaccuracies in spelling and usage.

### Final Analysis
Given the criteria and the student's performance:
- The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, though there are several errors.
- The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, and the errors do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms, though there are some inaccuracies.

Considering the forgiving nature of the grading and the overall performance, the student’s answer fits best in **Level 2**. The errors are frequent but do not severely hinder understanding, and the use of specialist terms is good despite some inaccuracies.

the doorway is the German Kaiser.","From Source A, we can see a depiction of a Russian Bolshevik revolutionist with ‘German gold’ trying to maim what looks out to be the tsarist depiction of Russia, and in the background we can see the German Kaiser Wilhelm the second plotting. Contextually we can infer that sential Communist Lenin was sent from Switzerland to Russia where he was exiled to stir up tensions on Russia so that the Germans could get some relief off the Eastern front. The style of clothing that the Russian Imperialist is wearing represents royalty which ties into the fact that Russia had its monarchy killed during the revolution to show its harsh and neglect that it gave to the Russian people centuries prior. Lenin was sent by Kaiser Wilhelm as he knew a time like this for Russia would be perfect as he was brought major famine and poverty to Russia, so he wanted change.
","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the depiction of the Bolshevik with ""German gold"" and the German Kaiser in the background. They also provide some contextual knowledge, mentioning Lenin's return to Russia and the impact of the Bolshevik Revolution. However, the analysis lacks clarity and coherence, and the connection between the source and its critical nature towards the Bolsheviks is not fully developed. The student does not explicitly explain how these features are critical of the Bolsheviks, nor do they provide a clear link between the source and the historical context.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to provide a more developed analysis, clearly explaining how the source is critical of the Bolsheviks and supporting this with more detailed factual knowledge. For example, they could explain that the cartoon is critical because it shows the Bolsheviks betraying Russia by making peace with Germany, which allowed Germany to focus its forces on the Western Front, thus betraying the Allies.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B, the picture depicts a array of soldiers - most likely to be on the Allied forces - crossing over no man's land with shells firing over them at a constant rate. Contextually we know that during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the battle of Passchendaele. In 1917, the British forces were able to tactically redirected the way they used artillery by creating a creeping barrage where in a certain order a certain amount of shells could be fired upfront at the troops to clear any enemy ground/territory, which provided as a explosive shield which now able to give them easier access towards the trench for bayonett charging. This was vital to break the stalemate as a historian can gather the fact that the German forces were overwhelmed at the change in fire rate which  was able to will thousand more proving to be more effective. Due to the smoke after the

explosion, the Germans couldn't also see the advancing troops in front of them which caused major distress. Source C brings the idea of tanks into the question which was a revolutionary idea at the time as there was anything like it. In September 1916 the first battalion of tanks were deployed into the Battle of the Somme which allowed for the ease of movement to continue. Trenches had become ineffective for the Germany as they could have just been ran over. Barbed wire which was a massive problem until this point also became ineffective as tanks could have just flattened them causing no distress from when explosives blew them up which only led to them becoming noisy. The tanks had a 360 turret which was later developed which could shoot from anywhere. In the Battle of Cambrai, 1917 they were able to use the tanks for a circular formation in rows as the Battle of the Somme let only 50 tanks remaining from the 400 used. Towards the end of the war which was a vital asset for the allied victory as the Germans could really fight back.

","The student provides a detailed analysis of both sources, showing a good understanding of the content and context. For Source B, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and its tactical significance during battles such as the Somme and Passchendaele. They highlight how this tactic helped break the stalemate and provided cover for advancing troops, making the source useful for understanding changes in military tactics.

For Source C, the student discusses the introduction and impact of tanks, particularly the 'Whippets' during the German Spring Offensive. They explain how tanks overcame obstacles like barbed wire and trenches, and how their use evolved over time, making them a crucial asset for the Allied forces.

The student also attempts to evaluate the provenance of the sources, noting that Source B is a picture published in a British newspaper and Source C is an account from a tank commander. However, the evaluation of provenance could be more developed, particularly in explaining how the nature of these sources affects their utility.

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the content and context of both sources and provides some evaluation of their utility. To reach the highest level, the student could further develop their evaluation of the provenance and provide a more explicit comparison of the sources.

  example_answer: []",,"In the 19th Century just after the Franco-Prussian war which was a victory for Prussia, Alfred von Schlieffen created a plan which was fairly simple in a way to take out two of Europe’s biggest powers: France and Russia doing this by gathering a number of 750,000 troops, going through Alsace-Lorraine taking out France before diverting for Russia taking both out in the general scheme, however there was major flaws to this. Number one was that sometime before the war, France had created the Maginot line to protect himself from Germany if they were to ever attack again. This meant Germany had to divert for Belgium. However, in 1839 the Treaty of London was signed with Britain giving full support for Belgium as they gained independence from any country willing to attack them. This meant if Germany diverted for Belgium they would face a double threat with Britain joining the war. The Belgian army too would be employed adding resistance towards the Germans. On the Eastern side, Russia before the war was able to muster up men in the course of 4 weeks which wasn't apart of Germany plan as they assumed Russia would be the attack as a surprise. This led to a war on two fronts. The BEF also came in time to support the invasion before the Germans got to Paris.","The student provides a detailed account of the Schlieffen Plan and its intended strategy, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding. They mention key elements such as the plan's origin, the involvement of France and Russia, and the number of troops involved. The student also identifies significant flaws in the plan, such as the existence of the Maginot Line, the Treaty of London, and the rapid mobilization of Russian forces.

However, the answer lacks a clear focus on how these events led to problems in 1914. While the student mentions the involvement of Britain and the Belgian resistance, they do not explicitly link these points to the broader consequences and problems that arose from the failure of the Schlieffen Plan. The analysis of causation and consequence is present but not fully developed.

To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more coherent narrative that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding, explicitly linking the flaws in the Schlieffen Plan to the resulting problems, such as the stalemate on the Western Front and the prolonged nature of World War I.

    - N/A",,"The alliance system in the first World War and the years building up to that was vital for the causes and the actual outcome of the war. I agree with this statement as there were many factors for this argument including: The Brothers alliance, Dual alliance which turned to the Triple alliance and the Entente Cordiale/Entente Alliance. In the late 19th century France and Russia as well as Austria-Hungary and Germany allied to protect themselves from each other in case of a war. The entente cordiale in 1904 was also another reason why tensions fired up with the old Entente and Germany due to the Moroccan crisis. These two events and their conferences started a clear divide in those countries listed as France wanted more colonies however this was disrupting the Kaiser's Weltpolitik which was his world view and the way he wanted to grow his empire doing this by trying to help at Morocco. In the Balkans the tension between the alliances of the Balkan League and the Ottoman empire stirred up causingfor two wars which left that are with nonstop raising tensions. Russia and Serbia had a brotherhood alliance as they were both Slavic. Bosnia another slavic county was going to get annexed by austria (which already had previous tensions with Russia). This angered the Serbains leading the Russians backing them up in justification of a war. The Germans however were not happy with this giving Austria a blank check allowing them for help whenever they need it also giving Russia a ultimatum to stop and back out of Autria-Hungary and Serbian tensions which they desired. 

Another alliance between the French and the Belgians also stopped and aggrovated German plans for WWI in attacking france Belgian led to Britain joining the war which would become a burden for the Kaiser. This caused a massive divide in the Nations of Europe which was a factor of the July crisis which ultimately ended up with the start of world war one. In conclusion we can see that the build up of allinnces between certain countries in Europe and Asia (Japanese and the British) led to a mess as various problems were split through various different nations. This includes Italy who was originally part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria but however to unprecedented events switched to the Entente side by the start of the war.

","The student begins by addressing the given factor, the alliance system, and provides a range of accurate and detailed knowledge about various alliances such as the Dual Alliance, Triple Alliance, and Entente Cordiale. The explanation includes specific events like the Moroccan Crisis and the tensions in the Balkans, which are relevant to the question. The student also mentions the ""blank check"" given by Germany to Austria-Hungary and the ultimatum to Russia, showing a good understanding of the complexities involved.

The second paragraph continues to explain the impact of alliances, particularly the French-Belgian alliance and its role in bringing Britain into the war. The student makes a clear link to the July Crisis and the eventual outbreak of World War I, demonstrating a developed, sustained line of reasoning.

However, the answer lacks a complex, sustained line of reasoning that fully substantiates a well-judged relevance. The conclusion attempts to summarize the points made but does not provide a sustained judgement that ties all the factors together in a coherent and logical structure.

To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex explanation of the relationship between the causes and form a sustained judgement. This could include evaluating the relative importance of the alliance system compared to other factors, such as militarism, imperialism, and nationalism, and how these interplayed to lead to the outbreak of the war.

","### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Spelling and Punctuation
- **Spelling**: The student has made several spelling errors, such as ""aggrovated"" (aggravated), ""allinnces"" (alliances), ""Autria"" (Austria), ""Serbains"" (Serbians), and ""causingfor"" (causing for). However, these errors do not severely hinder the meaning of the text.
- **Punctuation**: The student has used punctuation inconsistently. For example, there are missing commas and periods that could have improved the readability of the text. The sentence ""This angered the Serbains leading the Russians backing them up in justification of a war."" could be clearer with better punctuation.

#### Grammar
- **Grammar**: The student demonstrates a general control of grammar, but there are several grammatical errors. For example, ""Bosnia another slavic county was going to get annexed by austria"" should be ""Bosnia, another Slavic country, was going to be annexed by Austria."" Additionally, ""This caused a massive divide in the Nations of Europe which was a factor of the July crisis which ultimately ended up with the start of world war one."" could be clearer with better grammatical structure.

#### Use of Specialist Terms
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""Triple Alliance,"" ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""Weltpolitik,"" ""Balkan League,"" ""Ottoman Empire,"" ""blank check,"" and ""July crisis."" These terms are appropriate and relevant to the topic.

### Final Assessment
Based on the Mark Scheme:

- **Level 1 Criteria**: The student does not meet the criteria for Level 1 as there are several spelling and punctuation errors, and the control of grammar is not consistently accurate.
- **Level 2 Criteria**: The student meets most of the criteria for Level 2. The spelling and punctuation are considerably accurate, and the grammar shows general control of meaning. The student also uses a good range of specialist terms.
- **Level 3 Criteria**: The student exceeds the criteria for Level 3 as the errors do not significantly hinder the meaning, and the range of specialist terms used is more extensive than limited.

Given that I am a forgiving grader and the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic with considerable accuracy in spelling, punctuation, and grammar, I would place this answer in **Level 2**.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B and C are very useful to an historian studying military technologey and tactics in the First World War because source B shows how the tactic rolling barrage worked. It was a slow-paced artillery attack which consisted of a line of artillery far back out of sight and then tanks and soldiers. This tactic became very efficient when radios were developed as the front line could talk to the artillery and tell them where to fire.

Source C is also very important as a historian as it shows how the development of tanks changed the course of the war. Tanks were firsted used in the battle of somme yet they werent as effective until later on in the war. Infact tanks were so effective that they completely stopped stalemate all together. Britain were also so good at making tanks that when a tank broke down the Germans would capture it and fix it so that they could use it instead. ","The student demonstrates an understanding of both sources and provides some contextual knowledge to support their analysis. However, the evaluation of the sources is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth.

For Source B, the student explains the tactic of the rolling barrage and mentions the development of radios, which is relevant contextual knowledge. However, the explanation could be more detailed, and the evaluation of the source's utility could be more explicit. The student should explain why this source is useful to a historian, such as by highlighting how it provides insight into the evolution of military tactics during the war.

For Source C, the student discusses the development and effectiveness of tanks, mentioning their first use at the Battle of the Somme and their role in breaking the stalemate. This is good contextual knowledge, but the evaluation of the source's utility is again somewhat basic. The student should explain why Mitchell's account is valuable, such as by noting that it is a first-hand account from a tank commander, which provides a detailed and personal perspective on the use of tanks in battle.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 2 due to the simple evaluation of the sources based on content and some contextual knowledge. To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide more detailed and extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources, including a more thorough evaluation of their provenance.

  example_answer: []",,The Schlieffen plan led to problems because Germany thought they could beat France in only 6 weeks which turned out to not be the case meaning they had to fight a war on two fronts as Russia was about to start invading showing that Germany over estimated themselves which was a large factor on why they lost the war as it is much harder to fight a battle on two fronts. ,"The student's answer identifies a key issue with the Schlieffen Plan: the underestimation of the time required to defeat France and the resulting need to fight a war on two fronts. This demonstrates a basic understanding of causation and consequence, moving the answer beyond level 0. However, the answer lacks specific factual knowledge and detailed analysis, which are required for higher levels.

To reach level 2, the student would need to provide a structured account with specific knowledge, such as mentioning the German advance through Belgium, the involvement of British troops, or the Battle of the Marne. The answer should also show a simple understanding of sequencing, explaining how these events led to the problems faced by Germany.

    - N/A",,"I do agree that the alliance system was a main cause of the first world war as Britain would have never been dragged into the war because of it's alliance with Belgium which stated Britain had to support Belgium if they were ever invaded and Germany invaded Belgium to get to France. However I believe another very important cause to world war one was the war at sea as Britain are very patriotic about there Navy once they saw Germany building up there Navy Britain had to make theres larger because of the two power standard this lead to a Naval race which end with war at sea. This war did not get well for the Germans as The British's naval blockade of German ports was so good that 420,000 German troops died of starvation as not enough food was getting through. It also meant that Germany didn't have enough resource to carry on in this Industrial war.

Yet another key cause of the war was the Moroccan crisis as in 1906 France wanted to own Morocco which everyone was fine with except from Germany who was openly expressing that Morocco should be an indepent country yet France didnt care about what Germany had to say and expanded Morocco into there empire and gave Germany a small part of Africa to compensate them this didnt sit well with the kaiser as he felt humiliated and tention grew between France and Germany. Later on in 1911 a rebellion happen in Morocco so the king of Morocco asked France for help and so France deployed 20,000 troops in Morocco, Germany got news of this and though France were trying to invade Morocco so the Kaiser decided to deploy battleship all around Morocco as people realised what the Kaiser wanted after this incident other nations started preparing for war.

So my conclusion is that although the alliance system was an important factor to the build up of the war it wasnt the main factor and it was in fact a mix of all these things put together.  ","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the alliance system, and provides a specific example of how it led to Britain entering the war due to its alliance with Belgium. This shows some specific knowledge and understanding, placing the answer into level 2. However, the explanation is brief and lacks depth.

The student then moves on to explain other factors, such as the naval race between Britain and Germany and the Moroccan crisis. These explanations are more detailed and show a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. The student explains how these factors contributed to the tensions leading to the war, which is indicative of level 3.

The conclusion attempts to make a judgement, stating that the alliance system was an important factor but not the main one, and that it was a combination of multiple factors that led to the war. This shows an attempt at a sustained judgement, which is a characteristic of level 4. However, the overall coherence and logical structure of the answer are not fully developed, and the reasoning is not as complex as required for level 4.

Overall, the answer falls into level 3 due to the developed explanation of multiple factors and the attempt at a sustained judgement. To reach level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex explanation with a sharper focus on coherence and logical structure.

So my conclusion is that although the alliance system was an important factor to the build up of the war it wasnt the main factor and it was in fact a mix of all these things put together.  ","To assess the student's answer, we will evaluate it against the criteria provided in the Mark Scheme for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG). We will also consider the use of specialist terms. Let's break down the assessment step-by-step:

### Spelling and Punctuation
1. **Spelling:**
   - Correct: ""alliance,"" ""system,"" ""cause,"" ""war,"" ""Britain,"" ""Belgium,"" ""Germany,"" ""France,"" ""patriotic,"" ""Navy,"" ""blockade,"" ""ports,"" ""starvation,"" ""resource,"" ""Industrial,"" ""Moroccan,"" ""crisis,"" ""independent,"" ""empire,"" ""compensate,"" ""rebellion,"" ""deployed,"" ""battleship,"" ""conclusion.""
   - Incorrect: ""it's"" (should be ""its""), ""theres"" (should be ""theirs""), ""didnt"" (should be ""didn't""), ""tention"" (should be ""tension""), ""though"" (should be ""thought""), ""happen"" (should be ""happened""), ""wasnt"" (should be ""wasn't"").

2. **Punctuation:**
   - Correct: The student uses commas and periods, but there are some missing commas that would improve readability.
   - Incorrect: Missing apostrophes in contractions (e.g., ""didnt"" should be ""didn't""), inconsistent use of commas, and some run-on sentences.

### Grammar
- The student generally maintains control of meaning, but there are several grammatical errors:
  - ""Britain would have never been dragged into the war because of it's alliance with Belgium"" (should be ""its alliance"").
  - ""Britain are very patriotic about there Navy"" (should be ""their Navy"").
  - ""this lead to a Naval race which end with war at sea"" (should be ""this led to a Naval race which ended with war at sea"").
  - ""This war did not get well for the Germans"" (should be ""This war did not go well for the Germans"").
  - ""as The British's naval blockade"" (should be ""as the British naval blockade"").
  - ""as not enough food was getting through"" (awkward phrasing, could be ""as insufficient food was getting through"").
  - ""Germany didn't have enough resource"" (should be ""resources"").
  - ""Morocco should be an indepent country"" (should be ""independent country"").
  - ""this didnt sit well with the kaiser"" (should be ""this didn't sit well with the Kaiser"").
  - ""tention grew between France and Germany"" (should be ""tension grew between France and Germany"").
  - ""a rebellion happen in Morocco"" (should be ""a rebellion happened in Morocco"").
  - ""though France were trying to invade Morocco"" (should be ""thought France was trying to invade Morocco"").
  - ""the Kaiser decided to deploy battleship all around Morocco"" (should be ""the Kaiser decided to deploy battleships all around Morocco"").
  - ""as people realised what the Kaiser wanted"" (awkward phrasing, could be ""as people realized the Kaiser's intentions"").
  - ""it wasnt the main factor"" (should be ""it wasn't the main factor"").

### Use of Specialist Terms
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms: ""alliance system,"" ""war at sea,"" ""Naval race,"" ""naval blockade,"" ""Moroccan crisis,"" ""Kaiser,"" ""Industrial war,"" ""rebellion,"" ""deploy,"" ""battleship.""

### Conclusion
- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, but there are several errors that prevent it from being considered ""considerable accuracy.""
- **Grammar:** The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, and while there are errors, they",3,3,4,3.0,3.0,True,1.0,0.0,,,,,10.62776780128479,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 869, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.004345, 'completion_tokens': 799, 'completion_cost': 0.011985, 'total_cost': 0.01633}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 837, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.004185, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.004200000000000001}"

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B, the image shows British soldiers advancing under a artillery barrage and it shows the soldiers moving forwards behind every artillery bomb, this is a great tactic because bombs that drop make it uneasy to see the soldiers as there is smoke everywhere and the lines represent the artillery bombs falling down.

Furthermore, source C was a tank commander, who was stuck and German soldiers were ready to attack the tank but when the commander looked to his right, he saw seven of the newest and fastest tanks, 'Whippets', spring into action. This goes to show that military weapons are useful and helpful during the war.  ","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides a basic analysis of their content. For Source B, the student describes the image and explains the tactic of advancing under an artillery barrage. For Source C, the student summarizes the account of the tank commander and highlights the effectiveness of the new tanks, 'Whippets'. However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include any contextual knowledge or evaluation of the provenance of the sources.

To improve this answer and reach a higher level, the student would need to:

1. **Provide Contextual Knowledge**: Include more detailed information about the tactics and technology used during the First World War. For example, explain the development and impact of the creeping barrage tactic and the introduction of tanks like the 'Whippets'.

2. **Evaluate Provenance**: Discuss the reliability and usefulness of the sources based on who created them, when they were created, and their purpose. For example, Source B is a newspaper image from 1917, which might have been intended to boost public morale. Source C is a first-hand account from a tank commander, which might provide a more accurate depiction of the events.

3. **Link to Utility**: Explicitly state how the content and provenance of each source make them useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

The Germans underestimated the resolve and reaction times of its enemies. However, whilst the Germans were not successful in their primary objective, neither were they entirely defeated. When both sides sought to protect the territory gained by digging trenches, stalemate resulted.'

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen Plan led to problems in 1914 because the plan was that. to prevent Germany having war's at two front's, the Western and Eastern front, they wanted to end it quickly before it was too late. Germany wanted to invade France and defeat them quickly within six weeks and then defeat Russia because the Germans thought that they weren't prepared and were weak. But this didn't go well because the Russians were fully prepared and strong to fight back which caused Germany to wait longer and Germany had to go through Belgium and claim it, then do a surprise attack on France by going round the French troops and surrounding them. But this also failed because Britain and Belgium had an alliance and Britain joined in and backed Belgium causing WWI in 1914. ","The student provides a basic narrative of the Schlieffen Plan and its intended goals, which moves the answer beyond level 0. The answer identifies the main elements of the plan, such as the quick defeat of France and the subsequent focus on Russia, and mentions the involvement of Britain due to its alliance with Belgium. This demonstrates a basic understanding of the sequence of events and some specific knowledge, placing the answer in level 1.

However, the analysis is quite limited and lacks depth. The student does not fully explain the consequences of the Schlieffen Plan's failure or how it led to problems in 1914, such as the resulting stalemate and trench warfare. To reach level 2, the student would need to provide a more structured account with specific knowledge and understanding, showing a simple analysis of causation and consequence.

The student does not fully explain how the Alliance System led to the escalation of the conflict or how it contributed to the outbreak of World War I.

The student briefly mentions Weltpolitik and the German Kaiser's ambitions, but this point is not developed or linked back to the Alliance System in a meaningful way. The answer lacks a coherent structure and a sustained line of reasoning, which are necessary for higher levels.

The alliances meant that you would have more power and strength and this is what the German Kaiser wanted more of, known as Weltpolitik, which is his view of the world and wanted to be the strongest country in the world. ","To assess the student's answer, we will evaluate it against the criteria provided in the Mark Scheme for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG). We will also consider the use of specialist terms. Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling:
- The student spells most words correctly, including complex terms like ""Schlieffen plan,"" ""entente cordial,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" and ""Weltpolitik.""
- There are no noticeable spelling errors.

### Punctuation:
- The student uses commas and periods, but there are some issues with punctuation:
  - The sentence ""I mainly agree with this statement because the alliance between Britain and Belgium also caused ww1 because after Germany invaded Belgium Britain stepped and that caused another major problem to Germans Schlieffen plan and there were already alliances that built up tension before the war, such as the entente cordial, which include, Britain, France and Russia and the triple alliance, which included Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy."" is a run-on sentence and lacks proper punctuation.
  - The phrase ""Britain stepped and that caused another major problem to Germans Schlieffen plan"" is missing punctuation and clarity.
  - The term ""ww1"" should be capitalized as ""WW1.""

### Grammar:
- The student generally uses grammar correctly but there are some issues:
  - The sentence structure is sometimes awkward and unclear, particularly in the long run-on sentence.
  - The phrase ""Britain stepped and that caused another major problem to Germans Schlieffen plan"" is grammatically incorrect and unclear.
  - The use of ""include"" instead of ""included"" in ""which include, Britain, France and Russia"" is incorrect.

### Specialist Terms:
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""Schlieffen plan,"" ""entente cordial,"" ""triple alliance,"" and ""Weltpolitik.""
- These terms are used appropriately and demonstrate a good understanding of the topic.

### Analysis:
- **Spelling:** The student spells with consistent accuracy.
- **Punctuation:** There are issues with punctuation, particularly with run-on sentences and missing punctuation marks.
- **Grammar:** The student uses grammar with general control of meaning, but there are some awkward and unclear sentences.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Given the criteria and the student's performance:
- The student spells with consistent accuracy, which is a strong point.
- The punctuation and grammar issues prevent the answer from reaching Level 1.
- The use of specialist terms is good, but not wide-ranging enough to compensate for the punctuation and grammar issues.

Therefore, the student's answer fits best in **Level 2**. The student demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and a good range of specialist terms, but the punctuation and grammar issues indicate general control rather than effective control.

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The answer does not clearly identify a specific way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate. The statement ""The internet may affect where a business chooses to locate as it could help them see if there are any gaps in the market through social media"" is vague and does not directly address the location aspect. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The explanation provided is not sufficiently clear or developed. The candidate mentions that the business ""may locate near to these customers to attract more,"" but this is not well connected to the initial point about identifying market gaps through social media. The explanation lacks depth and does not clearly link the use of the internet to the decision of physical location. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

   - Decrease = 1,500 units (1 mark)

### Given Answer:
1. **Step 1:**
   - The candidate starts with an incorrect equation: \( 4000 = 10000 / 5.25 \)
   - This is incorrect and does not follow the correct formula.

2. **Step 2:**
   - The candidate correctly calculates the new break-even level: \( 10000 / (6.5 - 2.5) = 2500 \)
   - This part is correct and matches the mark scheme.

3. **Step 3:**
   - The candidate states the new break-even level as 2500 units but does not explicitly calculate the decrease.
   - The decrease should be \( 4000 - 2500 = 1500 \) units, which is not explicitly mentioned.

### Mark Allocation:
- **Substitution into correct formula:** The candidate correctly calculates the new break-even level using the formula \( \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = 2,500 \). This earns 1 mark.
- **Correct final answer:** The candidate does not explicitly state the decrease as 1,500 units, so this part does not earn a mark.

### Final Mark:
- **Total Marks Awarded:** 1 out of 2

1. **Challenge**: The candidate states that Amelia seeks a challenge, which will motivate her to work harder and gain a better reputation, potentially increasing revenue and sales. This is developed with the context of Amelia wanting to work at the 'highest standard' and her previous experience working for a company. This aligns with the indicative content that suggests the challenge of setting up a business in a competitive market could be a driving force for Amelia (AO2). The candidate also connects this to potential business success, which aligns with the idea that Amelia would be determined to succeed (AO3a).

2. **Personal Satisfaction**: The candidate mentions that personal satisfaction is another aim, as Amelia believes more women customers will be attracted to her business because she is a woman. This creates a Unique Selling Point (USP) to attract customers. This aligns with the indicative content that Amelia may want to gain more independence and that being a female business owner in a male-dominated industry could give her an extra incentive to do well (AO2 and AO3a).

The candidate uses contextual information such as Amelia's desire to work at the highest standard and her belief in attracting female customers.
- **Analysis (AO3a)**: The response deconstructs the information, finding interconnected points with chains of reasoning. The candidate explains how the non-financial aims will impact Amelia's motivation and business success, although there are some logical inconsistencies, such as the direct link between motivation and increased revenue without further elaboration.

  - The internet will not provide focused information to let Amelia know if there will be enough demand for her plumbing and building services (AO2).
  - Although she knows how many females live in Birmingham, it would be difficult to find out how many of them own a property or would want a female plumber to work in their homes (AO3a).
  - Lili Heating Ltd will be in competition against other established plumbers. Amelia will need to spend more time developing her target market to make sure there are enough potential customers (AO3a).

Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families.

","The candidate's response identifies both positive and negative impacts of using secondary research for Lili Heating Ltd. 

**Positive Impact:**
- The candidate states that secondary research is ""easy to find and costs less than primary research."" This is a valid point and aligns with the indicative content that secondary research is a fast and convenient way to gather information.
- The candidate further develops this by stating that it will give Lili Heating Ltd ""more time and money to invest into the business,"" which could ""increase the quality"" of the business. This is a logical chain of reasoning, although it could be more explicitly linked to the context of the business.

**Negative Impact:**
- The candidate mentions that secondary research ""is not as relevant as primary research,"" which could give Lili Heating Ltd ""a false understanding of customers."" This aligns with the indicative content that secondary research may not provide focused information.
- The candidate further develops this by stating that it may make customers feel their needs are not being met, potentially reducing loyalty and sales. This is a logical chain of reasoning and is well-developed.

- The response includes some contextual elements such as ""Lili Heating Ltd"" and ""customers,"" but it lacks specific details from the context provided, such as Amelia's unique selling point or the specific needs of her target market.

","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer provides a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful: ""it will allow them to help eliminate stereotypes."" This is a valid point and is linked to the broader societal impact of reducing gender stereotypes in the workforce.
  - The answer further develops this point by stating, ""They can use her business as an example to other women that not only men can do physical labor which may motivate more women to work and find jobs reducing unemployment."" This development is linked and provides a clear rationale for why the government would support the success of Lili Heating Ltd.
  - The final part of the answer, ""This means there are more people for the government to tax,"" ties the argument back to a direct benefit for the government, which is increased tax revenue from higher employment.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are clearly linked. The initial reason (eliminating stereotypes) is developed through the potential societal impact (motivating more women to work), and this is further linked to a direct benefit for the government (increased tax revenue).

- **Example Answers:**
  - The answer aligns well with the example answers provided in the mark scheme. It offers a reason (eliminating stereotypes) and develops it with a clear link to government benefits (increased employment and tax revenue).

Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Lili Heating Ltd should choose option 1. This is the better option compared to option 2 as she is already trying to promote her business through customers so using social media would be a waste of time. Choosing option 1 will help keep loyalty within female customers. This is because they do not have to pay as much which attract them even more. Having more loyalty will increase sales as more customers are attracted. Another positive of option 1 is that it may attract even more new customers. This is because discounting female customers betters her unique selling point making her business stand out to competitors. This will attract more customers which will increase sales and revenue to invest. Another positive is that she may gain promotion from option 1 anyway. This is because if any customers are satisfied with the service and price they may be more likely to recommend her business to others. This will increase her customer base and market share.
","The candidate begins by stating that Lili Heating Ltd should choose option 1, providing a clear stance. They justify this choice by discussing the potential benefits of maintaining customer loyalty and attracting new customers, which demonstrates sound application of business concepts (AO2). The candidate also mentions that using social media would be a waste of time, which shows an understanding of the business context, although this point could be more developed.

The answer includes interconnected points with chains of reasoning, such as the link between customer loyalty, increased sales, and revenue for reinvestment. However, there are some logical inconsistencies, such as the assumption that social media would be entirely ineffective, which is not fully justified. This places the analysis (AO3a) in Level 2.

The candidate makes a judgement and provides a justification based on the evaluation of the benefits of option 1, such as increased customer loyalty and market share. However, the evaluation is not thorough and lacks detailed interconnected points, which limits it to Level 2 (AO3b).

Overall, the answer demonstrates sound understanding and application of business concepts with some inconsistencies and provides a justified judgement based on evaluation.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","There is a lack of security as if there is no wind they won't receive any energy or anything else from Ripple or the turbine.
","Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""There is a lack of security as if there is no wind they won't receive any energy or anything else from Ripple or the turbine.""
   - This statement identifies a risk related to the dependency on wind for energy production. If there is no wind, the investors may not receive the energy they need, which is a valid risk.

### Comparison with Example Answers:
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme include:
  - ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm""
  - ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs""
  - ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy""

The given answer aligns closely with the second example answer, ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs,"" as it highlights the risk of not receiving energy due to lack of wind.

### Marking Notes:
- The marking notes specify that to award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application.
- The answer applies the context of Ripple's dependency on wind energy, which is a specific and relevant risk for investors.

### Conclusion:
The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple by stating the dependency on wind for energy production and the potential lack of energy if there is no wind. This is a valid and contextually relevant risk.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","One benefit to customers of Ripple asking for their needs is that the customers needs are being met. This makes the customers feel more satisfied and valued at Ripple which will make them more loyal.
","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer identifies a benefit to customers by stating, ""the customers needs are being met."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying a benefit to customers of Ripple. Therefore, this part of the answer satisfies the criteria.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer provides linked development by explaining that meeting customer needs ""makes the customers feel more satisfied and valued at Ripple which will make them more loyal."" This development is logical and directly linked to the initial benefit identified. However, the answer lacks specific evidence of application to Ripple's context, such as mentioning the green energy plan or the investment in the wind farm. The context provided in the answer is generic and does not specifically refer to Ripple's unique business model or services.

- **Example Answers as a Guide:**
  - The example answers in the mark scheme provide specific benefits and linked development, such as ""Customers will receive the correct green energy plan"" and ""This will make sure they receive the correct amount of energy for their needs."" The given answer does not provide this level of specificity or direct application to Ripple's context.

- **Marking Notes:**
  - According to the marking notes, to award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. Since the answer provides linked development but lacks specific application to Ripple's context, it does not fully meet the criteria for 2 marks.

    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

This is because they have plans to create 220,000 new jobs. Paying for training will significantly reduce Ripple's costs and overheads. This will benefit Ripple as it will allow them to invest, expand and grow the business. Another benefit of this is that it may make the quality of Ripple better. This is because the workers have proper training which may attract more customers as the workers are providing better work. Another positive of this is that it may motivate the workers to work harder. This is because they feel valued as they have been given proper training and have been set a high standard to work at. This may maximize output and efficiency for Ripple which will help them grow as they won't be losing as much.
","The candidate begins by stating that the government should choose option 2 for Ripple, which is a clear stance. They provide a rationale for this choice by discussing the government's plan to create 220,000 new jobs and how paying for training will reduce Ripple's costs and overheads. This demonstrates an application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context of Ripple (AO2).

The candidate then elaborates on the benefits of this option, such as allowing Ripple to invest, expand, and grow the business. They also mention that proper training may improve the quality of Ripple's services, attract more customers, and motivate workers, which could maximize output and efficiency. These points show interconnected reasoning and a sound evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3a and AO3b).

However, the answer lacks some depth and detailed interconnected points that would be required for the highest level. The reasoning is sound but not thoroughly detailed, and the evaluation, while present, could be more comprehensive.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","The importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix is significant as it helps them to compete. This is because they question customers to find out how much energy they use. This helps Ripple create a price for the customer to invest and helps to reduce how much the customers pay. This helps to match and offer lower prices to competitors. This may attract customers as price is a customer need. Another reason why price is important is that it helps to determine how much energy a customer gets. This is important as it will increase the reliability and quality of their service and product as it lets them know that they are getting value for their money. This may keep customers more loyal and increase Ripple's sales. However, price may not be as important in Ripple's marketing mix. Place is also an important part. This is because Ripple needs to locate its turbines to the areas with the most wind. This will help increase the productivity of the turbines which will help improve the efficiency. This will give the customers a lower price which may attract them even more. Where they are located is also important as it may require them to pay more to transport energy to customers, raising their prices. This may prevent customers from using Ripple as they may not get the energy as fast and may have to pay a higher price for the energy compared to competitors.Another important factor of Ripples marketing mix is its promotion. This is because they have to promote how environmentally friendly this energy is compared to others. This will help attract more customers and target those who wish to be more environmentally friendly. This will help to increase their sales as more people are aware of how environmentally friendly they are.
","The candidate begins by discussing the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix, noting that it helps Ripple compete by offering lower prices based on customer energy usage. This demonstrates an understanding of the business concept and its application to Ripple's context (AO2). The candidate explains how this pricing strategy can attract customers and increase loyalty, which shows some interconnected points with chains of reasoning (AO3a).

The candidate then considers other elements of the marketing mix, such as place and promotion. They argue that the location of turbines is crucial for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, which can impact pricing and customer attraction. This shows a broader understanding of the marketing mix and its components (AO1b). The discussion on promotion highlights the importance of Ripple's environmentally friendly image, which can attract customers who prioritize sustainability.

The evaluation of price versus other elements of the marketing mix is sound but lacks depth in some areas. The candidate makes a judgment that price is significant but also acknowledges the importance of place and promotion. However, the justification for these points could be more detailed and interconnected (AO3b).

Overall, the response demonstrates mostly accurate knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with appropriate use of business terminology. The application to Ripple's context is sound, though there are some inconsistencies. The deconstruction of business information shows interconnected points with some logical inconsistencies. The conclusion is based on a sound evaluation but could be more thorough.

Based on the mark scheme, this response fits into Level 2. The candidate demonstrates mostly accurate knowledge and understanding (AO1b), sound application to the business context (AO2), interconnected points with some inconsistencies (AO3a), and a sound evaluation (AO3b).

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by

Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Both source B and C are useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics.

Source B is a picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. This image would be useful because it portrays the soldiers pattern and movement to advance under an artillery barrage. This would help understand tactics used to get from your trench to your enemies trench.

Source C would be helpful to a historian studying military technology and tactics because it comes from an first commander in World War I who had experienced tank warfare. The story shows how powerful and quick tank are ""destroying the German threat"". This would help them study the importance of tanks in the war and how they significantly changed the battlefield.","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student notes that it shows soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage, which helps understand the tactics used in trench warfare. For Source C, the student highlights that it is a first-hand account from a tank commander, demonstrating the power and speed of tanks in the war.

However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include extended reasoning or detailed factual knowledge. The evaluation of the provenance is also minimal.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan led to problems in 1914 because it caused Britain to join the war. This is because a German general called Erik Von Schlieffen had come up with a plan to go to war with France. However they knew that they couldn't attack France head on since they had many troops there. This meant that they had to invade France from a different angle. Germany had decided to invade France by going through Belgium from above France and working there way down to Paris. The plan was estimated to take about 6 weeks before they could beat France and return back to Germany before Russia attacked. However, Britain had signed a treaty with Belgium to protect them at any cost. So when Belgium was invaded by Germany, Britain had to do something so they ended up joining the war against Germany. This was a big problem for Germany because the now had to fight against 3 major countries from 2 different angles.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer explains the German strategy to invade France through Belgium and the resulting involvement of Britain due to the treaty with Belgium. This shows a simple analysis of causation/consequence, placing the answer in Level 2.

Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling:
- The words used in the answer are spelled correctly. There are no spelling errors.

### Punctuation:
- The sentence ""I agree with this statement because both the triple alliance and the triple entente led to conflict."" is punctuated correctly.
- However, the sentence ""this is because once Britain had"" starts with a lowercase ""t"" which should be capitalized as it begins a new sentence. This is a punctuation error.

### Grammar:
- The first sentence ""I agree with this statement because both the triple alliance and the triple entente led to conflict."" is grammatically correct.
- The second part ""this is because once Britain had"" is an incomplete sentence and lacks grammatical structure. It leaves the reader hanging and does not convey a complete thought.

### Use of Specialist Terms:
- The student uses the terms ""triple alliance"" and ""triple entente,"" which are appropriate specialist terms related to the topic of the First World War.

### Analysis:
- **Spelling**: The student spells words with consistent accuracy.
- **Punctuation**: There is a minor punctuation error with the lowercase ""t"" at the beginning of the second sentence.
- **Grammar**: The student demonstrates some control of grammar, but the incomplete sentence ""this is because once Britain had"" indicates a lack of effective control of meaning.
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses a limited range of specialist terms appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme, the student's answer does not meet the high performance criteria of Level 1 due to the punctuation error and incomplete sentence. It also falls short of Level 2 because the control of meaning is not general but rather somewhat lacking due to the incomplete sentence. However, the answer does meet the criteria for Level 3, as the spelling is reasonably accurate, the punctuation error does not significantly hinder meaning, and there is some use of specialist terms.

### Final Marks:
The student should be awarded **1 mark**.

      Source C is useful because the author is an experienced soldier. His account gives an accurate picture of the threat posed by Germany’s successful advance in the Spring Offensive using storm troopers. The new design of British tank was one of the ways in which this threat was countered.'

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B there is a creeping barrage being shown. In this movement, artillery would be sent over the top into no man's land and blow up just in front of the soldiers. While doing this, a huge smoke cloud would be created so soldiers could advance. The soldiers also would've used the Lewis gun which was a lighter machine gun seen as the first assault rifle. Secondly, planes could be used during the creeping barrage to further distract the enemy and make it easier for the soldiers. While doing this advancement, few men were killed by the explosion but it was a faster way of reaching the enemy trench line where the bayonets could be used too. In source C it talks about the use of tanks during WWI. Tanks could be used to squash barbed wire which would be lined across no mans land and also on enemy trenches. Doing this would create a ‘path’ for soldiers to follow without the risk of the barbed wire. Tanks were also used for that fear factor as they were new and fast with a machine gun which would scare enemies. ","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying key features and explaining their relevance to military technology and tactics in the First World War. For Source B, the student describes the creeping barrage tactic and mentions the use of the Lewis gun and planes, which shows some understanding of the content. For Source C, the student explains the role of tanks in overcoming barbed wire and their psychological impact on the enemy.

However, the answer lacks detailed evaluation of the provenance of the sources and does not fully develop the reasoning related to their utility. The student does not explicitly link the content and provenance to the usefulness of the sources for a historian studying the First World War. Additionally, the answer does not evaluate the relationship between the sources or provide a sustained judgment.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to:
1. Provide more detailed factual knowledge and understanding related to the features of the sources.
2. Evaluate the provenance of the sources, considering aspects such as the date, author, and purpose.
3. Develop extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources.
4. Evaluate the relationship between the sources and provide a sustained judgment.

In doing this, Germany attracted Britain and Russia's attention. The Schlieffen plan's idea was to invade France through Belgium but to stop this, Britain 'set up' the Battle of the Marne and Somme to attempt to slow down the Germans. As a result this caused a stalemate with neither side moving and the eventual failure of the Schlieffen plan. ","The student identifies the basic premise of the Schlieffen Plan and its intended execution, which moves the answer beyond level 0. The answer is presented in a structured account, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question, such as the invasion of France through Belgium and the involvement of Britain and Russia. This places the answer in level 2.

However, the analysis is quite simple and lacks depth. The student mentions the Battle of the Marne and the resulting stalemate but does not provide detailed factual knowledge or a developed analysis of causation and consequence.

The triple entente consisting of France, Britain and Russia, and the Triple alliance with Germany, Italy and Austria-Hungary. As a result of this if one country from each side got dragged into war they would have to defend their fellow country. This is part of the cause for the first world war.

Another reason was the murder of Franz Ferdinand who was murdered in Serbia by a group called the black hand. This caused huge conflict between Germany and Serbia but Serbia was part of the Balkans which consisted of Serbia, Slovakia and other countrys around that area of europe. 

The final reason for the cause of the first world war was Germany were hungry for power and this was shown clearly by Kaiser Wilhelm Welt Politik policy. Kaiser Wilhelm believed that Germany should rule the whole of Europe. Other country needed to stop this from happening so when Germany invaded France he invaded the triple entente. 

In conclusion I somewhat agree that alliances were the main cause of world war one as they wasnt the reason for the murder of Franz Ferdinand or Germany wanting power over other nations.","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, and provides a basic explanation of how alliances could lead to a larger conflict. They mention the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, but the explanation lacks depth and specific factual knowledge. This places the answer in Level 1 initially.

In the second paragraph, the student introduces another factor, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. They provide some context but do not fully explain how this event led to the broader conflict. The explanation is basic and lacks detailed knowledge, keeping the answer in Level 1.

The third paragraph discusses Germany's ambitions and Kaiser Wilhelm's Weltpolitik policy. The student mentions Germany's desire for power and the invasion of France but does not provide a developed explanation or detailed factual knowledge. This paragraph remains at a basic level of explanation.

The conclusion attempts to make a judgement but is repetitive and does not add any new insights. The overall structure of the answer is coherent, but the explanations are basic and lack the depth required for higher levels.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 1 due to the basic explanations and lack of detailed factual knowledge. The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the factors but does not develop their reasoning or provide sufficient detail to reach higher levels.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows how British infantry advanced under the tactic called creeping barrage. In the source it shows British infantry advancing across no man's land while allied artillery shells were shot and exploded not too far in front of them while planes most likely allie planes were flying above communicating with the infantry and artillery to make sure they can surprise the Germans without mass casualties. This source can tell a historian how the creeping barrage was used and how it worked. The source can tell a historian that artillery was shot at a certain angle, so it would land and explode not to go away from the infantry, so they have some sort of cover during a while they walked across no man's land. The historian can also interpret that the planes observing this are most likely coordinating the attack from above telling the artillery when and where to fire and telling the infantry when and how far they should move. 

Source C shows a piece of a book written by a soldier that fought against the Germans during World War One. The source can tell a historian about how useful  the development of tanks during world war one. The source describes how a allied soldier was about to be attacked by german soldiers while stuck in a tank. This could tell a historian that tanks originally were always getting stuck and weren't that helpful at first but then the source describes how the allies were making fast and most likely more powerful tanks as the war went on. The source describes whippets as faster and newer than the one that the writer was using yet again giving back to how the allies we contantly upgrading these tanks. The source then describes how the wippets while giving their machine guns drove straight into the german soldiers and this caused them to scatter. This can tell a historian that first this was a time where tanks only had machine guns and not an artillery cannon welded onto of them and two the fact that these tanks could eliminate a german trench with ease. Source C really highlights how important tanks were to during the first world war.

While source b shows the importance of tanks during the first world war with three example being the creaping barrage and Source C shows the the importance of technology and how important tanks were. In conclusion both Source B and C would show a historian how useful technology and tanks involved as the war continued and how the advancement and development of both was important to the allies winning the war.","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and provides a detailed analysis of their content. They identify relevant features and explain their significance, which is indicative of a higher-level response. However, the evaluation of the provenance is somewhat lacking, and the overall focus on utility could be more explicit.

In the first paragraph, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and how it is depicted in Source B. They mention the coordination between infantry, artillery, and planes, which shows a good understanding of the tactics used. However, the evaluation of the source's utility could be more explicit, and the provenance (the fact that it was published in a British newspaper in 1917) is not addressed.

In the second paragraph, the student analyzes Source C, describing the development and effectiveness of tanks during the First World War. They highlight the improvements in tank design and their impact on the battlefield. Again, the evaluation of the source's utility is implicit rather than explicit, and the provenance (the fact that it is an account by a tank commander published after the war) is not fully explored.

The final paragraph attempts to draw a conclusion about the usefulness of both sources, but it lacks a clear and explicit evaluation of their utility. The student mentions the importance of technology and tanks but does not fully address how the sources would be useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more explicit evaluation of the utility of both sources, including a detailed analysis of their provenance. They should also make a clearer connection between the content of the sources and their usefulness to a historian.

Overall, this answer falls into Level 3 due to the developed evaluation of the content of both sources.

  example_answer: []",,The Schlieffen Plan was a plan made by a top German general before the start of WW1. The Schlieffen Plan was a tactic that would make it so that Germany wouldn't have to fight a war on two fronts in the west against France and the in the east against Russia. The plan was the idea that the Germans would knock France out of the war in 6 weeks by capturing Paris. The Germans then thought that it would take 6 weeks for Russia to mobilize its army to the eastern front. Within those 6 weeks the German army would knock France out of the war then transport its entire army to the eastern front. This of course did not happen. The Schlieffen Plan was doomed to fail. It counted on luck and luck only. ,"The student provides a basic overview of the Schlieffen Plan, explaining its purpose and the intended sequence of events. This moves the answer beyond level 0, as it addresses the question and demonstrates some knowledge of the plan. However, the answer lacks detailed analysis of the consequences and problems that arose from the failure of the Schlieffen Plan. 

To reach level 2, the student would need to provide a structured account that demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. For example, they could explain how the German advance through Belgium was slowed down by fighting Belgian and British troops, and how this delay allowed the French to mobilize and push back the German front line, leading to the need for both sides to build trenches.

To reach level 3, the student would need to develop their analysis further, showing how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a stalemate on the Western Front and the digging of trenches that stretched across France. They could also discuss the impact of Russia mobilizing more quickly than expected, which forced Germany to send troops east and weakened their advance on Paris.

The triple entente consisted of Britian, France and Russia while the central powers consisted of Germany, Austria - Hungary and Italy. All countries in both alliances promised one thing, to defend each other against an attacking country. 

I do agree that the alliance system was a cause but not the main one. I do believe it is a cause because after the alliances were made tension in Europe increased due to all the big powers in Europe being in an alliance that meant if one country from one alliance attacked then a country from the other alliance it meant meant a full war in europe. The alliance also caused problems in other continents due to Germany wanting an empire of its own but couldn't because Britain and France had colonies there meaning Germany taking land near British and French colonies could cause a war between the 2 alliances.

 However the alliance system wasn't the only big reason why WW1 started. Another reason would be the fact that Germany wanted a navy that could rival Great Britain, which the British didn't want to happen due to their policy of a 2 power standard or that they must have the strongest navy. This lead to an arm race between Britain and Germany to see who could make the most and better weapons than the other. This caused tension to rise between both Britain and germany which didn't help with the fact that Germany had colonys near or not to British ones.

In conclusion although the alliance system was a big reason of why WW1 started I do believe that it is the main reason. Especially combined with the fact that Germany wanted more power in the first place and the creation of the Schlieffen plan even without the alliance system WW1 would of happened anyway. All it did was speed it up.
","The student begins by explaining the alliance system, identifying the Triple Entente and the Central Powers and their mutual defense agreements. This demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding of the stated factor.

In the second paragraph, the student provides a simple explanation of how the alliance system increased tension in Europe, noting that any conflict between two countries could escalate into a full-scale war due to the alliances. This explanation is coherent and structured, but it lacks the depth and detail required for higher levels.

The student then introduces another factor, the naval arms race between Britain and Germany. They explain how Germany's desire to rival Britain's navy led to increased tension and an arms race. This is a relevant point and shows specific knowledge and understanding, but the explanation remains simple and lacks the developed reasoning needed for level 3.

In the conclusion, the student reiterates that the alliance system was a significant cause but not the main one, suggesting that Germany's ambitions and the Schlieffen Plan would have led to war regardless. This shows an attempt to make a judgement, but the reasoning is not fully developed or substantiated.

Overall, the answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding of the stated factor and another factor, with a simple, sustained line of reasoning.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer step-by-step:

### Spelling and Punctuation
1. **Spelling:**
   - ""Britian"" should be ""Britain.""
   - ""Austria - Hungary"" should be ""Austria-Hungary"" (no space around the hyphen).
   - ""lead"" should be ""led.""
   - ""germany"" should be ""Germany.""
   - ""colonys"" should be ""colonies.""
   - ""would of"" should be ""would have.""

2. **Punctuation:**
   - The sentence ""The triple entente consisted of Britian, France and Russia while the central powers consisted of Germany, Austria - Hungary and Italy."" could use a comma before ""while"" for better clarity.
   - The phrase ""it meant meant a full war in europe"" has a repeated word ""meant.""
   - ""Europe"" should be capitalized.
   - The sentence ""This lead to an arm race between Britain and Germany to see who could make the most and better weapons than the other."" should be ""This led to an arms race...""
   - The sentence ""This caused tension to rise between both Britain and germany which didn't help with the fact that Germany had colonys near or not to British ones."" is a bit unclear and could be rephrased for better clarity.
   - The sentence ""In conclusion although the alliance system was a big reason of why WW1 started I do believe that it is the main reason."" should have a comma after ""In conclusion"" and ""started.""

### Grammar
- The student generally uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, but there are several areas where clarity is compromised due to grammatical errors.
- The sentence structure is mostly correct, but there are instances where the meaning is slightly hindered due to grammatical mistakes.

### Use of Specialist Terms
- The student uses several specialist terms such as ""triple entente,"" ""central powers,"" ""Schlieffen plan,"" and ""2 power standard.""
- The range of specialist terms is good but not particularly wide.

### Analysis
- The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, but there are several errors that prevent it from being considered ""considerable accuracy.""
- The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, but errors do hinder the overall clarity in some parts.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms, but not a wide range.

### Conclusion
Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best in **Level 3**. The student demonstrates reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, some control of grammar, and a limited but appropriate range of specialist terms.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B is from a British newspaper published in October 1917 showing how a creeping barrage works. A creeping barrage is where artillery would fire shells just in front of the soldiers which are slowly moving forward. The aim was to leave no enemies behind. The creeping barrage is one of the main reasons which led to Britain winning WWI.
Source C is from a book about tank warfare by Frank Mitchell who was a tank commander in WWI and is describing the German Spring offensive in April 1918. The source says that the tanks drove straight into the German soldiers and that they quickly destroyed the German threat. Tanks were a large metal vehicle which had cannons and machine guns on them. They were able to pretty much destroy everything that was in front of them. The sources are useful to someone studying military technology and tactics during the first world war because it shows how Britain were so much more advanced than the opposition. Tanks were really good as they could conquer a lot of land in a short amount of time than if it was just soldiers. ","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student explains the concept of a creeping barrage and its role in British military tactics. For Source C, the student describes the effectiveness of tanks, particularly the 'Whippets,' during the German Spring Offensive.

However, the evaluation of the sources' utility is quite simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not delve into the provenance of the sources or provide extended reasoning related to their utility. The analysis is more descriptive than evaluative, and there is a lack of detailed contextual knowledge to support the points made.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to:
1. Provide more detailed contextual knowledge about the use of creeping barrages and tanks during WWI.
2. Evaluate the provenance of the sources, considering factors such as the date of publication, the author's background, and the intended audience.
3. Offer extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources, explaining how they contribute to a historian's understanding of military technology and tactics during the First World War.

Some people may disagree with this statement because Germany was almost causing this themselves, as they wanted to be a global power so they were trying to take peoples land in order to do this.

Another reason why people might disagree is because of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Austria-Hungary knew it was Serbia so they began talks. But because Serbia didn't want any Austro-Hungarian police in their country, so Austria-Hungary started preparing for war.","The student begins by addressing the given factor, the Alliance System, and makes a clear statement agreeing with its importance. However, the explanation is quite basic and lacks detailed factual knowledge. The student incorrectly identifies the members of the Triple Entente and Triple Alliance, which undermines the accuracy of their argument. The correct members of the Triple Entente were Britain, France, and Russia, while the Triple Alliance consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.

The second paragraph introduces another factor, Germany's ambitions for global power, but the explanation is brief and lacks depth. The student does not provide specific examples or detailed reasoning to support this point.

But because Serbia didn't want any Austro-Hungarian police in their country, so Austria-Hungary started preparing for war.","To assess the student's answer according to the Mark Scheme, we need to evaluate the spelling, punctuation, and grammar (SPaG) as well as the use of specialist terms. Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling:
- The student spells all words correctly. There are no noticeable spelling errors.

### Punctuation:
- The student uses punctuation marks such as commas, periods, and apostrophes correctly in most instances.
- There is a minor issue with the use of quotation marks around ""Germany, Italy and Russia"" and ""Britain, France and Belgium."" These should be either single or double quotation marks consistently, but this is a minor issue.
- The sentence ""But because Serbia didn't want any Austro-Hungarian police in their country, so Austria-Hungary started preparing for war."" has an unnecessary conjunction ""so"" after the comma, which is a minor punctuation error.

### Grammar:
- The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are a few minor issues:
  - ""if it wasn’t for some countries having multiple allies then I don’t think that the first world war would have been on that scale."" This sentence could be more effectively structured for clarity.
  - ""There was the triple entente ‘Germany, Italy and Russia’ and then the triple alliance ‘Britain, France and Belgium’."" The use of ""was"" should be ""were"" to match the plural subject.
  - ""Austria-Hungary knew it was Serbia so they began talks."" This sentence is grammatically correct but could be clearer with a comma after ""Serbia.""

### Use of Specialist Terms:
- The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""alliance system,"" ""triple entente,"" ""triple alliance,"" ""global power,"" and ""assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.""
- The terms are used correctly and in context, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic.

### Overall Assessment:
- **Spelling:** Consistent accuracy.
- **Punctuation:** Considerable accuracy with minor errors.
- **Grammar:** General control of meaning overall with minor errors.
- **Specialist Terms:** Good range used appropriately.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best in **Level 2**. The minor errors in punctuation and grammar prevent it from reaching Level 1, but the overall control of meaning and use of specialist terms are strong enough to place it in the higher end of Level 2.

### Final Marks:
- **Marks Awarded:** 3 (High end of Level 2)

The student demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of grammar, and a good range of specialist terms, which justifies awarding 3 marks.",3,3,4,3.0,3.0,True,1.0,0.0,,,,,8.413118839263916,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 666, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.00333, 'completion_tokens': 560, 'completion_cost': 0.0084, 'total_cost': 0.011729999999999999}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 598, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.00299, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.003005}"

This has been used to show the actions of the Bolsheviks in December 1917 and how, encouraged by the kaiser in the doorway, they stole wealth from there own country, and gave it to the Germans. We know in late 1917 Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and lost lots of its land and resources in return for a cease fire in the Eastern Front. The British created the cartoon to show how the Triple Entente had been betrayed by russia and to criticise there actions; Russian withdrawl from the War meant war was only now fought from one front.","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the bearded man tussling with a young woman and the figure of the Kaiser in the doorway.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows a depiction of the Western Front with two types of new technology and tactics being shown. The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. 

Source C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C 
describes how the army constantly made new prototypes 
as the tanks so they could be faster and cause 
more casualties. This meant there was less hand to 
hand fighting because of the tanks physiological and 
devastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C 
is useful to a historian because it has personal 
story from someone actually experiencing the power 
of tanks, showing how the threat they brought. ","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and provides a developed evaluation of their content. For Source B, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and its significance in reducing casualties and improving the effectiveness of assaults. They also mention the role of improved communication, such as the use of radio, in coordinating attacks. This shows a good level of contextual knowledge and links it effectively to the source, making it useful for understanding military tactics and technology during the First World War.

For Source C, the student describes the evolution and impact of tanks, particularly the 'Whippets,' during the German Spring Offensive. They highlight the initial unreliability of tanks and their subsequent mass production and strategic use, which contributed to breaking the stalemate on the Western Front. The student also notes the personal perspective of the tank commander, which adds credibility and depth to the source.

However, the evaluation of the provenance of both sources could be more developed. For Source B, the student could discuss the potential bias of a British newspaper published during the war and how it might aim to boost morale or support for the war effort. For Source C, while the personal account adds authenticity, the student could consider the potential for bias in a post-war publication and the possible influence of the author's experiences and motivations.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 3 due to the developed evaluation of the content and the use of contextual knowledge. To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of the provenance and the relationship between the sources.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan already had some problems to it, even before it was put into practise. For example it relied on the slow mobilisation of Russia. As the Germans would find out, the Russian army mobilised in just 10 days and had already consigned plans to attack in the East. This meant the Germans would have to fight a war on two fronts, exactly what was trying to be avoided. Furthermore after the death of Alfred Von Schlieffen in 1913, the next general made the army smaller for the assault on France, and also missed Holland from the plan entirely. This meant the Germans would have a weaker force in battle, additioning to them having to divide there army in half to fight in two fronts.

The German plan also relied on Belgium’s invasion which they thought would be quick and easy. However, the Belgian army put up stiff resistance trying forts and its small army, slowing down the German advancement. This gave France and Russia time to communicate and mobilise. Furthermore the German army underestimated the pact Britain had with Belgium in the 1890's, supporting its neutralaty. Therefore when they invaded Belgium and entered through France, The BEF was sent out to stop the Germany army. to May 1914 France and the BEF fought the Germans at the battle of Mons, contributing to stalemate the failure of the Schielfen plan.","The student demonstrates a structured account with specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer identifies key problems with the Schlieffen Plan, such as the reliance on the slow mobilization of Russia and the underestimation of Belgian resistance. The student also mentions the impact of the death of Alfred Von Schlieffen and the subsequent changes to the plan, which weakened the German forces.

The first paragraph provides a simple analysis of causation/consequence by explaining how the rapid mobilization of Russia and the need to fight on two fronts led to problems for Germany. The second paragraph further develops the analysis by discussing the resistance of the Belgian army and the involvement of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which contributed to the failure of the Schlieffen Plan and the resulting stalemate.

To reach Level 4, the answer would need to display more complex analysis, such as explaining how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a prolonged stalemate and trench warfare on the Western Front. Additionally, the answer could benefit from more detailed factual knowledge and a clearer explanation of how each part of the sequence increased tension and led to a crisis.

When Britian Russia and France signed the Triple Entente in retaliation of the Triple Alliance Germany used it to complain that they were being circled in. The Triple entente was used to make Germany back down but could of been a factor for war. Once the two sides were created it was clear War was imminent but Germany and its allies were keen for war then in contrast France and Russia and Britain made a pact us Allience to detterent Germany.

However the assasination os archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbia's black hand Gang also was a jumpstart to war. After the Assassin Austria-Hungery blamed Serbia and had intellignce the Black hand Gang was helped by the Serb government this gave the kaiser a motivation for war due to it alliance with Austria - Hungery. The Austrian government gave Serbia a 10 point deal which they agreed to all but one (letting Austrian soldiers into Serbia). Within a

days War was declared. Russia was dragged in due to its alliance with Serbia and the Germans started there Schlieffen plan in the West turning the Balkans war to a world war.

Finally the Moroccan Crisis was another reason why Germany were happy for a war to start.
France wanted to take over Morocco but Germany also wanted to expand its empire so the kaiser sent a warship into the ports of Morocco to show Germany wanted to be part of World affairs too. The French were outraged and a meeting in Algeciras (Spain) with the USA, Britain, Germany and France calmed the situation down preventing early war. The kaiser did this to see how Sent France could be pushed but Germany was humiliated when Britain Supported France due to there alliance. In 1911 the French were called into Morocco to settle a rebellion but Germany accused France of invading the country. Ultimately it was declared France would take full control of Morocco which humiliated the Kaiser for a Second time. He wanted to prove Germany's strength and it was clear he would not back down a third time, therefor 
when Franz Ferdinand was killed, Germany declared War.","The student provides a basic explanation of the stated factor, the Alliance System, and other factors such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Moroccan Crisis. The answer demonstrates some specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question, but the explanations are not fully developed and lack coherence and logical structure.

The first paragraph addresses the Alliance System, mentioning the Triple Entente and Triple Alliance, but the explanation is somewhat vague and lacks depth. The student mentions that the Alliance System gave Germany an excuse to declare war, but does not fully explain how the alliances contributed to the escalation of the conflict.

The second paragraph discusses the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and its immediate consequences, including Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia and the involvement of Russia. This explanation is more detailed and shows a better understanding of the events leading to the war, but it still lacks a developed line of reasoning.

The third paragraph addresses the Moroccan Crisis, providing some specific details about the events and Germany's actions. However, the explanation is somewhat disjointed and does not clearly link the crisis to the overall cause of the war.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the factors leading to the First World War, but it lacks the developed explanation and coherence required for higher levels. The student needs to provide more detailed and structured explanations, linking the factors together to form a sustained judgement.

France wanted to take over Morocco but Germany also wanted to expand its empire so the kaiser sent a warship into the ports of Morocco to show Germany wanted to be part of World affairs too. The French were outraged and a meeting in Algeciras (Spain) with the USA, Britain, Germany and France calmed the situation down preventing early war. The kaiser did this to see how Sent France could be pushed but Germany was humiliated when Britain Supported France due to there alliance. In 1911 the French were called into Morocco to settle a rebellion but Germany accused France of invading the country. Ultimately it was declared France would take full control of Morocco which humiliated the Kaiser for a Second time. He wanted to prove Germany's strength and it was clear he would not back down a third time, therefor 
when Franz Ferdinand was killed, Germany declared War.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by

Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B and Source C are both very useful in helping historian understand tactics used in the war and the development of weaponry. Source B shows a artillery barrage which was the tactic the British used to make advances on the German trenches. An Artillery Barrage would consist of shooting multiple rounds of artillery on a set timetable at different distances to provide British troops in No Man's Land cover from any enemy defenses allowing the troops to cross No Man's Land with greater ease leading to a greater number of attacks onto German trenches. This source shows how tactics evolved throughout the war as they had thought of a more viable way of crossing No Man's Land with less German threat. Source C shows the evolution of tanks. At the start of World War 1 tanks were sent out on their own slowly, not posing much of threat to the enemy, but throughout the war tanks became one of the greatest threats to an enemy due to their improved speed and tactics used around them. The creeping barrage was one of the most successful tactics used at war. This would consist of sending out around a dozen tanks onto No man's land with hundreds of soldiers behind them. The soldiers behind would be safe to another German defenses because of the tanks blocking any bullets, also creating an easier way into enemy trenches because tanks would destroy any barbed wire in its way. Tanks would also have 360 machine guns attached to the top allowing it to send cover fire at German's.","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the content of both sources and provides some contextual knowledge to explain the tactics and technology used during the First World War. For Source B, the student explains the concept of an artillery barrage and how it was used to provide cover for advancing troops, showing an understanding of the evolution of tactics. For Source C, the student describes the development and use of tanks, particularly the 'Whippets,' and how they became a significant threat to the enemy.

However, the evaluation of the provenance of the sources is limited. The student does not explicitly address the reliability or perspective of the sources, which is necessary for a higher-level response. For example, they could have discussed the fact that Source B was published in a British newspaper during the war, which might have influenced its portrayal of British tactics to maintain public morale. Similarly, they could have evaluated the reliability of Source C, considering it was written by a tank commander who participated in the events described and was published after the war.

To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources, as well as discuss the relationship between the sources. They should also include more detailed factual knowledge to support their evaluation.

### Evaluation of the Answer:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The answer shows some calculations but does not clearly follow the correct formula. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Cost per Unit}}

   - The correct substitution should be:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The answer does mention ""2500 units,"" which is correct, but the working shown is incorrect and unclear.

2. **Calculation of decrease:**
   - The answer does not explicitly show the calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output.
   - The correct calculation should be:
     \[
     4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \text{ units}

- **Identification of a way:**
  - The answer identifies a way a small business could become more competitive by stating, ""A small business can become more competitive by having a USP."" This satisfies the first marking criterion. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the way:**
  - The explanation provided is, ""If a business has a unique selling point more customers will look to buy from the business leading to more profit."" This partially explains the way by indicating that a USP attracts more customers. However, it does not fully develop the explanation to show how this leads to competitiveness in comparison to competitors. The example answers provide a more detailed explanation, such as attracting customers because they think they are getting a better product or gaining a better reputation than competitors. The answer could be improved by elaborating on how the USP differentiates the business from its competitors and attracts customers away from them. (1 mark)

Overall, the answer identifies a way and provides a partial explanation, but it lacks a fully developed explanation to reach the highest mark.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan led to problems throughout Europe in 1914. The plan was for Germans to reach Paris in 6-10 weeks before Russia could mobilize its army. However, the Kaiser decided to pass through Belgium before going to Paris as he believed the French wouldn't expect this. Britain had made an agreement with Belgium to defend them if any country steps into their land, which led to Britain declaring war on the Germans, ruining their plans of reaching Paris in 6-10 weeks. This led to the German offensive on Verdun, an important French city historically. The Germans didn't want to reach Verdun they just wanted to bleed the French dry out of its artillery. The French responded by saying, 'we don't give Verdun up no matter what' France was near breaking point at the time of Britains defensive efforts at Marne. Britain launched an attack on the Germans at river Marne to relieve pressure of French soldiers in Verdun. This worked and France had saved Verdun. despite French and British soldiers having more deaths they saw this as a victory as they had more men to lose than the Germans who lost a lot of soldiers.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer begins by outlining the original plan and its intended timeline, then explains the deviation through Belgium and the resulting British involvement. This shows a clear understanding of the sequence of events and their immediate consequences.

The student also mentions the German offensive on Verdun and the subsequent Battle of the Marne, highlighting the strategic intentions and responses of the involved nations. This demonstrates a developed analysis of causation and consequence, as the student explains how the initial failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to further military engagements and strategic decisions.

However, the answer could be improved by providing more detailed factual knowledge and a clearer link to the overall problems caused by the Schlieffen Plan. For example, the student could elaborate on how the failure of the plan led to a prolonged stalemate and trench warfare, which were significant problems in 1914.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 3 due to its structured narrative and developed analysis, but it lacks the depth and range of detailed knowledge required for Level 4.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""the business can use this money to fund the manufacturing of a product instead of getting a bank loan."" This aligns with the mark scheme's example of retained profit being a cheap source of finance and not requiring interest payments. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

    - N/A",,"I slightly agree with this statement the alliance system lead to starting of the First World War. Firstly many of the powerful nations believed an alliance led to even greater power for both countries. Many leaders were power hungry and wanted to be the most powerful army which led to countries trying to test and break other alliances. The Germans tested the entente cordiale between France and Britain at the Morocco crisis. France wanted to colonise Morocco, Britain agreed and allowed France to do this. However Germany decided to see how strong the alliance was and defended Morocco from being colonised which created the tension between the entente cordiale and Germany. Tension between Russia and Austria rose during the Balkan crisis. Austria had annexed Bosnia which upset Serbia who asked their Slavic brothers Russia to defend them if war happened between Serbia and Austria. Austria had asked Germany for support after hearing this news leading Germany sending Austria a 'Blank Cheque' meaning they will defend Austria no matter what strengthening their alliance.

In conclusion, Alliance had a huge part to play in the beginning of World War 1 but so did power wanted by leaders who wanted to grow their empires.","The student begins by addressing the given factor, the alliance system, and provides a brief explanation of how alliances contributed to the tensions leading up to the First World War. They mention the entente cordiale between France and Britain and Germany's attempt to test this alliance during the Morocco crisis. They also discuss the tension between Russia and Austria during the Balkan crisis and Germany's support for Austria with the 'Blank Cheque'. This shows some specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question.

However, the explanation remains relatively simple and lacks the depth and detail required for higher levels. The student does not fully develop the reasoning behind how these alliances directly led to the outbreak of war. Additionally, the answer does not explore other significant factors that contributed to the war, such as militarism, imperialism, and nationalism, which are necessary for a more comprehensive analysis.

The conclusion is brief and reiterates the role of alliances but does not provide a complex, sustained line of reasoning or a well-judged relevance to the overall question. To reach higher levels, the student would need to provide a more detailed and developed explanation of the stated factor and other factors, demonstrating a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding.

If she can know when she is going to be in debt then she can look for ways to avoid it.,"**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""Financial information could help her through possible prediction of debts."" This outlines a way financial information could help forecast success by predicting potential financial challenges. This satisfies the first part of the marking criteria.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer continues with, ""If she can know when she is going to be in debt then she can look for ways to avoid it."" This provides a linked development by explaining how predicting debts can help Amelia take preventive measures. This satisfies the requirement for linked points.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are linked, this criterion does not apply.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide specific financial tools (cash-flow forecast, break-even forecast) and their direct benefits. While the student's answer does not specify a particular financial tool, it does explain a general benefit of financial forecasting (predicting and avoiding debt), which is valid.

**Marking Notes:**
- The marking notes emphasize the need for linked development and evidence of application. The student's answer provides linked development but lacks specific application to Amelia's business context (e.g., Lili Heating Ltd, plumbing supplies, female customers).

**Total Marks:**
- The answer provides a valid point with linked development but lacks specific application to the context of Amelia's business. Therefore, it should be awarded 1 mark.

Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling:
- The student spells most words correctly. There are no obvious spelling errors in the text.

### Punctuation:
- The student uses punctuation marks such as commas and periods, but there are some areas where punctuation could be improved for clarity. For example:
  - ""I slightly agree with this statement the alliance system lead to starting of the First World War."" should be ""I slightly agree with this statement; the alliance system led to the start of the First World War.""
  - ""Firstly many of the powerful nations believed an alliance led to even greater power for both countries."" should be ""Firstly, many of the powerful nations believed an alliance led to even greater power for both countries.""
  - ""In conclusion, Alliance had a huge part to play in the beginning of World War 1 but so did power wanted by leaders who wanted to grow their empires."" should be ""In conclusion, the alliance had a huge part to play in the beginning of World War 1, but so did the power wanted by leaders who wanted to grow their empires.""

### Grammar:
- The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some areas where it could be improved:
  - ""the alliance system lead to starting of the First World War"" should be ""the alliance system led to the start of the First World War.""
  - ""power hungry"" should be ""power-hungry.""
  - ""defended Morocco from being colonised which created the tension between the entente cordiale and Germany"" should be ""defended Morocco from being colonised, which created tension between the entente cordiale and Germany.""
  - ""Tension between Russia and Austria rose during the Balkan crisis"" should be ""Tensions between Russia and Austria rose during the Balkan crisis.""
  - ""Austria had asked Germany for support after hearing this news leading Germany sending Austria a 'Blank Cheque' meaning they will defend Austria no matter what strengthening their alliance."" should be ""Austria had asked Germany for support after hearing this news, leading Germany to send Austria a 'Blank Cheque,' meaning they would defend Austria no matter what, strengthening their alliance.""

### Use of Specialist Terms:
- The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""entente cordiale,"" ""Morocco crisis,"" ""Balkan crisis,"" ""annexed,"" and ""Blank Cheque.""

### Conclusion:
- The student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and uses relevant specialist terms. The spelling is accurate, and while there are some punctuation and grammatical errors, they do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.

### Final Analysis:
Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best in **Level 2**. The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, and employs a good range of specialist terms.

If she can connect with the target audience then they are likely to come back if they’re any other problems but are also likely to advise their friends family to go to Lili Heating LTD if they have any issues.,"The candidate identifies a non-financial impact related to Amelia's unique selling point (USP) of being a female plumber, which allows her to connect more closely with her target audience of females. This is a valid point and aligns with the indicative content that suggests Amelia's gender could be a driving force in her business success.

However, the response lacks depth and detailed development. The candidate mentions that connecting with the target audience could lead to repeat business and word-of-mouth recommendations, but does not fully explore the implications or provide a logical chain of reasoning. The answer is somewhat repetitive and does not demonstrate a thorough understanding of the business concepts and issues.

In terms of application (AO2), the response is limited. While the candidate mentions Amelia's USP and target audience, there is little contextualization beyond this. The response does not fully engage with the context provided in the question, such as the competitive environment in Birmingham or Amelia's desire for independence.

For analysis (AO3a), the response attempts to deconstruct the issue but does so in a limited manner. The connections between points are not well-developed, and the reasoning lacks depth and detail.

Based on the mark scheme:

- **Level 1**: Limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2). Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).
- **Level 2**: Sound application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context although there may be some inconsistencies (AO2).

Given the limited application and analysis, the response fits best in **Level 1**. The candidate has made an attempt to address the question but has not provided sufficient depth or detail to move beyond this level.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states ""promotion,"" which is indeed one of the elements of the marketing mix. This satisfies the requirement of stating an element of the marketing mix.

### Application to Context

- **Evidence of Application:**
  - The mark scheme requires evidence of application to award the mark. The answer ""promotion"" does not provide any specific context or application to Lili Heating Ltd. For example, it does not mention how promotion will be used to attract customers or any specific promotional methods that Amelia might use. The example answers in the mark scheme provide specific applications, such as ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" or ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham.""

### Conclusion

- The answer ""promotion"" correctly identifies an element of the marketing mix but lacks the necessary application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for awarding a mark.

### Final Mark

- **0 marks**: The answer does not provide sufficient evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd, as required by the mark scheme.

### Summary

- The answer correctly identifies an element of the marketing mix but fails to apply it to the specific context of Lili Heating Ltd, as required by the mark scheme.

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

### Marking Criteria:
- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful.**
  - The answer does not outline a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. Instead, it focuses on the unique selling point (USP) of the business, which is not directly related to the government's interest. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.**
  - The answer does not provide linked points. It only mentions the USP without connecting it to any government interest. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement for linked points and can only be considered for a maximum of 1 mark.

### Example Answers:
- ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful (1).""
- ""Taxes will be based on the profits it makes from plumbing repairs (1).""
- ""The government will want more people to be employed (1).""
- ""Amelia may employ more female plumbers if the business is a success (1).""

### Marking Notes:
- **Award up to 2 marks for linked points.**
  - The answer does not provide linked points, so it cannot be awarded 2 marks.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.**
  - The answer does not provide any valid reason why the government would want the business to be successful. It only mentions the USP, which is not relevant to the government's interest.

### Examiner Commentary:
The answer ""Her USP allows her to connect with female customers"" does not address why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. It focuses on the business's unique selling point, which is not relevant to the government's interest. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for linked points and does not provide a valid reason for the government's interest.

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","I believe Lili Heating LTD should choose option 2 because there are so many social media users and people think the business is good can share the company online easier. With her business being plumbing she is going to be needed to be concentrated online and people will find it easier if her business is being advertised on social media.

If she was to have a discounted price for females then she will have to advertise this offer and people are more likely to notice something online then they are in person.

In conclusion promoting her product online will help her reach her target customer of females and also another customer group of males which means she is likely to have more people interested in her business leading to more sales which will lead to a higher profit.

","The candidate begins by stating that Lili Heating Ltd should choose option 2, which is to use social media for promotion. This is a clear judgement. The candidate provides some reasoning for this choice, mentioning the widespread use of social media and the ease of sharing the company online. This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2), but it is not detailed or specific to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

The candidate then discusses the potential disadvantage of option 1, which is offering discounted prices to female customers, by stating that this would also require advertising. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but the reasoning is not fully developed or interconnected.

In the conclusion, the candidate reiterates the benefits of using social media, mentioning that it could help reach both female and male customers, leading to more sales and higher profit. This provides some justification for the judgement, but it lacks depth and detailed evaluation.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the business context (AO2). The analysis (AO3a) is basic and lacks interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The judgement and justification (AO3b) are simple and based on limited evaluation.

Based on the mark scheme, this answer fits the criteria for Level 1. The candidate makes a judgement and provides a simple justification, but the evaluation is limited and lacks depth.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",It won't always be windy so possibility of no energy,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer provided is: ""It won't always be windy so possibility of no energy.""
   - This statement identifies a risk related to the variability of wind, which could lead to periods where no energy is generated. This is a valid risk for investors in a wind farm, as the profitability and reliability of their investment depend on consistent energy production.
   - The mark scheme example answers include risks such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" and ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs."" The provided answer aligns with the second example, as it implies that investors may not receive enough energy due to the inconsistency of wind.
   - Therefore, the answer successfully states a risk for investors in Ripple.

### Conclusion:
- The answer meets the marking criteria by identifying a specific risk related to the variability of wind energy, which could affect the energy supply to investors.

Let's evaluate this answer against the marking criteria:

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple**:
  - The answer does mention a benefit to customers, which is that they can ""give their opinion and get the product adapted to that opinion."" This implies that customers' needs and preferences are taken into account, which is a benefit.

- **Linked development and evidence of application**:
  - The answer lacks linked development. It does not explain how giving their opinion and getting the product adapted to that opinion specifically benefits the customers in the context of Ripple. For example, it could have mentioned that this ensures customers receive the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs, which would have provided a clearer link to the context.
  - There is no specific evidence of application to Ripple. The answer does not mention any specific details about Ripple's process, such as creating a green energy plan or how this adaptation leads to better energy solutions for the customers.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

Also if the training is free then the business won’t have to spend money on employee training then there will be less cash outflow in the business leading to a higher profit.

If taxes paid by smaller business was to happen then the business would face less cash out flow but would still have to pay some taxes and all training required. Therefore option 2 is the better option for Ripple.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 would have a more significant impact on Ripple's success. They provide some application of knowledge (AO2) by discussing the benefits of free training for employees, such as better service and maintenance capabilities, and reduced cash outflow leading to higher profit. This application is sound but not detailed, placing it in Level 2.

The candidate then compares Option 2 with Option 1, noting that while reduced taxes would also decrease cash outflow, the business would still incur training costs. This comparison shows some interconnected points and chains of reasoning (AO3a), but it lacks the depth and logical consistency required for Level 3.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","price is a very importank to Ripple's Marketing Mix because if they don't have a price suitable to the market the customers are less likely to want their a product because if competitors have a cheaper price their product's better for money. This is why Ripple's claims of being able to supply energy for cheaper than competitors will attract more customers. Also, if the price is based on how much they need then there won't be any wasted energy and customers get spend equeivalent to how much they need leading to more sales.
","The candidate begins by stating that price is important to Ripple's marketing mix, but the explanation is somewhat vague and lacks depth. The candidate mentions that if Ripple's prices are not suitable, customers may choose competitors with cheaper prices, which is a valid point but is not elaborated upon sufficiently. The candidate does mention Ripple's claim of supplying energy cheaper than competitors, which is relevant and shows some application to the business context (AO2).

The second part of the response discusses the idea that pricing based on energy needs can prevent waste and lead to more sales. This point is relevant but is not fully developed or connected to the broader marketing mix or business strategy.

Overall, the response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts but uses limited business terminology (AO1b). The application of knowledge to the business context is present but not detailed or consistent (AO2). The response attempts to deconstruct business information but finds limited connections between points (AO3a). The conclusion is not well-developed and is supported by generic assertions (AO3b).

2500 units","To grade the provided answer, let's break down the steps according to the mark scheme and see if the student has shown the correct working and arrived at the correct final answer.

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - The student attempted to use this formula but made errors in the calculations:
     \[
     10,000 / 2.5 = 1,000 \quad \text{(Incorrect calculation)}
     \]
     \[
     6.30 - 2.30 = 4 \quad \text{(Incorrect values used)}
     \]
     \[
     10,000 / 4 = 2500 \quad \text{(Correct calculation with incorrect values)}
     \]

2. **Correct calculation of the new break-even level of output:**
   - The correct calculation should be:
     \[
     \frac{10,000}{6.50 - 2.50} = \frac{10,000}{4} = 2,500 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

3. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The student did not explicitly calculate the decrease, but they did find the new break-even level of output correctly (2,500 units).

4. **Final answer:**
   - The final answer should be:
     \[
     4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \quad \text{(Decrease in break-even level of output)}
     \]

**Grading:**

- The student made errors in the initial substitution and intermediate steps but arrived at the correct new break-even level of output (2,500 units).
- The student did not explicitly state the decrease in the break-even level of output (1,500 units).

**Marks Awarded:**

#### Identification of an advantage:
- **Criteria:** Identification of an advantage.
- **Response:** The candidate identifies an advantage by stating, ""it will have a good rating.""
- **Evaluation:** This satisfies the criteria as it identifies a potential benefit of meeting legal obligations.
- **Mark Awarded:** 1 mark.

#### Explanation of the advantage:
- **Criteria:** Explanation of the advantage.
- **Response:** The candidate attempts to explain the advantage by stating, ""this will satisfy the customer to come to the business.""
- **Evaluation:** The explanation is somewhat vague and lacks depth. It does not clearly link how meeting legal obligations directly leads to a good rating or customer satisfaction. The mark scheme examples provide more detailed explanations, such as avoiding financial consequences or improving employee motivation, which are more directly linked to meeting legal obligations.
- **Mark Awarded:** 0 marks.

  - 3",,A disadvantage of not paying your employees on time is that the employees could get tired of it and possibly quit the job then you have to go hire a new employee.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one disadvantage'. The candidate has suggested a disadvantage through 'the employees could get tired of it and possibly quit the job'. This is developed through 'then you have to go hire a new employee'. The candidate's response has stayed focused on the question. Below is the detailed analysis based on the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate identifies a disadvantage: ""the employees could get tired of it and possibly quit the job"". This matches the example answer ""One disadvantage is that the employees will want to leave the business"". Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. **1 mark awarded.**

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate explains the consequence of the disadvantage: ""then you have to go hire a new employee"". This is similar to the example answer ""This means the business may have to find new employees"". Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. **1 mark awarded.**
  - The candidate does not further develop the explanation to include additional consequences such as increased recruitment costs or impact on business operations. The example answer includes ""This may increase the recruitment costs of the business"". Therefore, the answer does not fully satisfy the second part of the explanation criterion. **0 marks awarded.**

£6 400","Based on the provided Mark Scheme and the Answer, here is the grading:

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The student has used the numbers from the question but has not substituted them correctly into the formula provided in the Mark Scheme. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     £4 000 + (£8 600 - £11 000)
     \]
   - The student instead calculated:
     \[
     11 000 - 8 600 = 2 400
     \]
     and then added £4 000 to get £6 400.
   - This is not the correct substitution into the formula, so no mark is awarded for this part.

2. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer provided by the student is £6 400.
   - The correct final answer should be £1 600.
   - Since the final answer is incorrect, no mark is awarded for this part.

However, the student did perform some calculations, even though they were not according to the correct formula. Given the instructions to award marks for correct working despite the final answer being incorrect, we can consider the following:

- The student correctly calculated \(11 000 - 8 600 = 2 400\), which shows some understanding of subtraction.

Given the above considerations, I would award 1 mark for the correct subtraction calculation, even though it was not part of the correct formula.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","I choose option 1 because a lot more girls come for the business. So if you give them a discount they will come a lot more or more females will starting coming.
","The candidate's response is very brief and lacks depth. The answer does not demonstrate a sound understanding of business concepts and issues relevant to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. There is a limited application of knowledge (AO2) as the candidate only mentions that more females will come if given a discount, without further elaboration or context. 

The analysis (AO3a) is minimal and does not provide interconnected points or logical chains of reasoning. The candidate does not deconstruct the business information or issues effectively. 

The judgement (AO3b) is very simple and lacks justification. The candidate does not provide a thorough evaluation of the business information or issues relevant to the choice made.

    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

","The candidate's response is very brief and lacks depth. They state that they would pick option 2 because it will help the business by having trained employees, which means they will do a good job and make more money for the business. 

**Application (AO2):**
- The response shows a limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context. The candidate mentions that trained employees will do a good job and make more money for the business, but this is a very basic point and lacks specific context related to Ripple.

**Analysis (AO3a):**

**Evaluation (AO3b):**

**Mark Scheme:**
1. Substitution into the correct formula:
   \[ \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}} \]
   \[ \text{New Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = 2,500 \text{ units} \]
   Decrease = 4,000 - 2,500 (1 mark)
2. Answer: 1,500 units (1 mark)

**Given Answer:**
\[ 10,000 / 2.5 = 4,000 \]

**Evaluation:**

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The given answer does not correctly substitute into the formula. The correct formula should be:
     \[ \text{New Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} \]
   - The given answer incorrectly uses:
     \[ 10,000 / 2.5 = 4,000 \]
   - This is not the correct substitution, so no mark can be awarded for this step.

2. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer should be the decrease in the break-even level of output, which is:
     \[ 4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \text{ units} \]
   - The given answer does not provide the correct final answer.

- The given answer does not show the correct working or the correct final answer.

Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer states, ""she is an entrepreneur who will have to pay taxes on all her money meaning that they get more money from her taxes."" This outlines a reason why the government would want the business to be successful, as it links the success of the business to increased tax revenue for the government. This satisfies the marking criteria for linked points.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are linked. The candidate connects the success of the business to the government receiving more tax revenue. Therefore, this criterion does not apply as the points are linked.

- **Example answers:**
  - The answer aligns with the example answer, ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful (1)."" The candidate's response similarly mentions that the government will get more money from taxes if the business is successful.

- **Award any other valid answer. To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer provides linked development by explaining that the government will receive more money from taxes if the business is successful. However, it lacks specific evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. The response does not mention any specific details about the business, such as its location in Birmingham, the unique selling point of being a female plumber, or the nature of the plumbing services provided.

Option 1 is a viable option, however her USP is already that she is a woman which would attract women already, showing that she doesn't need to use option 1. In conclusion, while option one is a good idea option 2 is a great one as it provides free advertising for the business and will often attract more people than just giving out a discount.
","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 would be a better choice, providing a basic justification that social media would not cost any money and would be easier to gain attraction. This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2), but it is limited and lacks depth. The candidate then briefly mentions Option 1, noting that Amelia's unique selling point (USP) as a woman would already attract female customers, suggesting that Option 1 is unnecessary. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but it is simplistic and not well-developed.

The final conclusion reiterates the preference for Option 2, emphasizing the benefit of free advertising and the potential to attract more customers. However, the reasoning is not detailed, and the connections between points are limited.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts (AO2), with basic analysis and minimal justification (AO3a and AO3b). The response fits the criteria for Level 1.

Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","One benefit is that it then provided with a set price which is based on their greenhouse gas electricity amount.
","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""it then provided with a set price which is based on their greenhouse gas electricity amount."" This suggests a benefit related to pricing based on specific energy needs, which aligns with the context of Ripple providing tailored energy plans. However, the phrasing is somewhat unclear and lacks precision. The benefit is implied but not explicitly clear.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer does not provide a clear linked development. The statement ""based on their greenhouse gas electricity amount"" is vague and does not clearly explain how this benefits the customer. There is no explicit mention of how this tailored pricing benefits the customer in terms of cost savings, efficiency, or meeting their specific energy needs.

- **Contextualization:**
  - The answer does not effectively use the context provided. It mentions ""greenhouse gas electricity amount,"" which is not a term used in the context. The context talks about green energy plans and investment in wind farms, but this is not clearly linked in the answer.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The answer attempts to outline a benefit but lacks clarity and precise linkage to the context. It does not fully meet the criteria for linked points with clear development and evidence of application.

**Marks Awarded:**
- Based on the marking criteria, the answer does not fully satisfy the requirements for 2 marks due to the lack of clear linked development and precise contextualization. Therefore, it should be awarded 1 mark.

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm.

This would help significantly because there would be more profit that month to spend on other locations. For example, improving products. 
Although option 2 does have some decent benefits, it can also have downsides. For example, some employees may not take in the information provided and more than likely the training will be very basic and the business will have to pay for extended training.

In conclusion, option is the best as it provides the most significant benefits.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 1 (paying less rent) is the most significant, providing a basic justification that it would result in more profit to spend on other locations or improving products. This demonstrates a limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context of Ripple (AO2), placing it in Level 1.

The candidate then briefly considers Option 2, mentioning potential downsides such as employees not absorbing the training information and the need for extended training. This shows an attempt to deconstruct business information and issues, but the connections between points are limited and lack depth (AO3a), which is also characteristic of Level 1.

The conclusion reiterates that Option 1 is the best choice but does not provide a thorough evaluation or detailed justification based on the business context (AO3b). This simple judgement based on limited evaluation further supports placing the answer in Level 1.

Price also helps Ripple because with the money provided by customers, they can upgrade technology and make it even cheaper.","The candidate begins by stating the importance of price for Ripple, mentioning that it claims to be the best-priced energy-efficient company. This aligns with the context provided, where Ripple claims to supply energy cheaper than its competitors. However, the explanation is quite limited and lacks depth.

In the second sentence, the candidate attempts to link the importance of price to customer attraction, but the reasoning is somewhat vague and not well-developed. The mention of customers wanting cheap energy to have more items such as going shopping is not directly relevant to the business context of Ripple.

The second paragraph briefly touches on the reinvestment of money provided by customers to upgrade technology and make energy even cheaper. This point is relevant but again lacks detailed explanation and connection to the broader business context.

Overall, the response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts but with limited business terminology and application to the specific context of Ripple. The analysis is superficial, and the evaluation is minimal.

This is a valid point, although it is not directly listed in the example answers. According to the marking notes, any appropriate response should be accepted. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the identified advantage**: The candidate does not provide an explanation of why being able to take loans out from banks is an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The response lacks further development, such as explaining how this ability to take loans could benefit the business in terms of financial stability or growth. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied. **(0 marks)**

  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""the business could sell things online on their website."" This satisfies the first marking criterion as it identifies the use of the internet for e-commerce. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the way by mentioning, ""depending on how far away the buyer lives, the price of delivery could be higher."" This explanation is somewhat relevant but lacks depth and clarity. It does not fully explain how the internet affects the choice of location for the business. The explanation should ideally connect the use of e-commerce to the potential for choosing a cheaper location or the need for good internet connections, as indicated in the example answers.
  - The candidate's explanation does not clearly link the identified way to the impact on the business's location choice. The response could be improved by elaborating on how selling online might reduce the need for a physical retail location or how it might necessitate a location with good internet connectivity.

Overall, the candidate identifies a relevant way but provides an incomplete and somewhat unclear explanation. Therefore, the answer should be awarded 1 mark for identification and 1 mark for a partial explanation.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B would be useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. The image shows the creeping barrage. Artillery strikes would be on a timer and every time there was an explosion, the Brits would move forward. When in the trench, they would use the sword on the end of their gun to attack. Source B also shows planes flying over the battlefield. This could be showing airstrikes and dogfights between the Brits and Germany.

Source C would be useful to an extent to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. The text is showing a tank commander's experience of the war and is telling the story of a tank battle during the German spring offensive. This could not be true on the other hand and it could be a British soldier Trying to make his side look good. ","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some basic analysis. For Source B, they describe the image and explain the concept of the creeping barrage, as well as mentioning the presence of planes, which could indicate airstrikes or dogfights. This shows a basic understanding of the content and some contextual knowledge.

For Source C, the student identifies that it is a first-hand account from a tank commander and describes the events of a tank battle during the German Spring Offensive. They also raise the possibility that the account could be biased, which shows some consideration of the provenance.

However, the evaluation of both sources is quite simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not provide extended reasoning or detailed factual knowledge to support their analysis. Additionally, the evaluation of the provenance is not fully developed, especially for Source B.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed contextual knowledge, develop their analysis further, and offer a more thorough evaluation of the provenance of both sources. They should also explicitly link their analysis to the usefulness of the sources for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

Decrease = 4,000 – 2,500 (1)
Answer: 1,500 units (1)",,"10,000 ÷ 2.50 = 4000,","To grade the provided answer, let's break down the steps according to the mark scheme:

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Cost per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{New Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's evaluate the provided answer:

- The provided answer is:
  \[
  10,000 ÷ 2.50 = 4000
  \]

- The answer does not correctly follow the formula for the break-even level of output after the increase in the selling price. It incorrectly divides the fixed costs by the variable cost per unit instead of the difference between the new selling price and the variable cost per unit.

  - The candidate identifies a disadvantage by stating, ""the employees could then sue the business for more."" This is a valid disadvantage as it highlights a potential legal repercussion of not paying employees on time. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate explains the disadvantage further by stating, ""This could make the business lose money and maybe lead to bankruptcy."" This explanation provides a clear consequence of the initial disadvantage identified, showing a logical progression from the legal action to financial loss and potential bankruptcy. This satisfies the explanation criteria.

The candidate's response is coherent and directly addresses the question by identifying a disadvantage and explaining its potential impact on the business. The explanation is sufficiently developed to warrant full marks.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer mentions that ""Financial information in a business plan could help Lili Heating Ltd because she is inexperienced."" This statement is somewhat relevant but does not directly outline a specific way financial information could help forecast success. The marking criteria require a clear outline of how financial information can aid in forecasting success, which is not fully addressed here.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer attempts to link the financial information to practical applications by stating, ""Financial information could help her company because then she would know what to do in regards of an overdraft and advertising."" However, the linkage is weak and lacks specific details or development. The example answers provide clear, linked points such as cash-flow forecasts ensuring enough cash for supplies or break-even forecasts setting profit targets. This answer does not meet that standard.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**

The Black Hand gang and Austria-Hungary then had a conference and Austria-Hungary gave a ten point altimatum. Serbia refused to have Austria-Hungarian police in their country so declined. Fighting broke out between the two countries and other countries joined in, creating World War One. ","To assess the student's answer according to the Mark Scheme, we need to evaluate the spelling, punctuation, grammar, and use of specialist terms. Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling
- ""altimatum"" should be ""ultimatum.""
- ""Austria-Hungarian"" should be ""Austro-Hungarian.""

Other than these two errors, the spelling is accurate.

### Punctuation
- The punctuation is generally correct. The student uses commas and periods appropriately.
- The use of apostrophes in ""don't"" is correct.
- The sentence structure is clear and well-punctuated.

### Grammar
- The grammar is mostly accurate, with a few minor issues:
  - ""The alliance system caused the triple alliance between Italy, Germany and Austria-Hungary to happen."" This sentence could be more concise, but it is grammatically correct.
  - ""The Black Hand gang and Austria-Hungary then had a conference and Austria-Hungary gave a ten point altimatum."" This sentence is a bit awkward and could be clearer. It would be better to split it into two sentences for clarity.
  - ""Serbia refused to have Austria-Hungarian police in their country so declined."" This sentence is slightly awkward. It could be rephrased for clarity, e.g., ""Serbia refused to allow Austro-Hungarian police in their country and thus declined the ultimatum.""

### Use of Specialist Terms
- The student uses several specialist terms appropriately: ""alliance system,"" ""triple alliance,"" ""assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Black Hand gang,"" ""conference,"" ""ultimatum,"" and ""World War One.""
- The range of specialist terms is good, though not exceptionally wide.

### Conclusion
Based on the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- **Spelling and Punctuation**: The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though there are a couple of spelling errors.
- **Grammar**: The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall. There are minor issues, but they do not significantly hinder meaning.
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses a good range of specialist terms as appropriate.

Given the overall performance, the student meets the criteria for Level 2. The errors present are minor and do not significantly hinder the overall meaning. The use of specialist terms is good, though not wide enough to reach Level 1.

Given the limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context, and the lack of detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning, the response fits the criteria for Level 1.

The answer identifies a potential negative impact of using the internet to collect secondary market research, stating that ""Secondary research is not always accurate."" However, this statement is not developed or contextualized within the specific business context of Lili Heating Ltd.

**Level Determination:**

- **Application of Knowledge and Understanding (AO2):** The response shows limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context. The candidate does not provide any specific details about Lili Heating Ltd or how the inaccuracy of secondary research might impact the business. Therefore, this aspect fits the Level 1 descriptor.

- **Analysis (AO3a):** The response attempts to deconstruct the issue but finds limited connections between points. The candidate does not provide any logical chains of reasoning or interconnected points. The statement is too general and lacks any detailed analysis. This also fits the Level 1 descriptor.

**Mark Assignment:**

Given the limited application of knowledge and understanding, and the lack of detailed analysis, the response fits within Level 1. Comparing this to exemplar materials, the response is at the lower end of Level 1 due to its brevity and lack of development.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - **Criteria:** The answer must state one element of the marketing mix.
   - **Evaluation:** The answer states ""Product,"" which is one of the elements of the marketing mix. This satisfies the criteria.

2. **Evidence of application.**
   - **Criteria:** To award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd.
   - **Evaluation:** The answer simply states ""Product"" without any specific application to Lili Heating Ltd. The context mentions that the product is to ""repair/install boilers,"" but this is not explicitly stated in the answer. Therefore, the answer does not provide evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1:** ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham"" (1)
  - This example provides a specific application to Lili Heating Ltd by mentioning the distribution of services to customer homes in Birmingham.
- **Example Answer 2:** ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (1)
  - This example provides a specific application to Lili Heating Ltd by mentioning promotion methods to attract female customers.
- **Example Answer 3:** ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1)
  - This example provides a specific application to Lili Heating Ltd by mentioning the specific product offered.

### Conclusion

The answer ""Product"" does state one element of the marketing mix, but it lacks the necessary application to Lili Heating Ltd as required by the mark scheme. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for awarding a mark.

  - The candidate states, ""because they can tax them,"" which outlines a reason why the government would want the business to be successful. However, there is no linked development or further explanation provided. The response lacks depth and does not fully develop the point.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.**
  - The response does not provide linked points. It only states a single reason without any development or additional context. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a maximum of 1 mark.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",If a wind turbine stops working they will have no source of profit,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria and the context provided.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

#### Criteria: Stating one risk for investors in Ripple

- **Evaluation**: The answer states, ""If a wind turbine stops working they will have no source of profit."" This statement identifies a risk related to the operational reliability of the wind turbines, which could impact the profitability and return on investment for investors.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1**: ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm (1)""
  - **Comparison**: The given answer implies a potential loss of profit due to operational issues, which is similar to the risk of losing money invested.

- **Example Answer 2**: ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs (1)""
  - **Comparison**: The given answer does not directly address the energy supply but focuses on the financial impact of a turbine failure, which could indirectly affect energy supply.

- **Example Answer 3**: ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy (1)""
  - **Comparison**: The given answer does not address market demand but rather operational risks, which is a different aspect of business risk.

### Marking Notes Application

- **Evidence of Application**: The answer must show evidence of application to the context of Ripple. The context mentions that Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to customers. If a wind turbine stops working, it directly affects Ripple's ability to generate and supply energy, which in turn impacts the profitability and return on investment for the members who have invested in the wind farm.

### Conclusion

- The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple by stating that a wind turbine failure would result in no source of profit. This is a valid risk as it directly impacts the financial returns for investors.
- The answer is supported by the context, which explains that Ripple manages the wind farm and supplies energy based on investments. A turbine failure would disrupt this process.

  - 2","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",Ripple can then find out what customers want and adjust their products or service to fit the majority.,"**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""Ripple can then find out what customers want and adjust their products or service to fit the majority."" This implies a benefit to customers as Ripple will tailor their offerings to better meet customer needs. However, the benefit is not explicitly clear or directly linked to the context of Ripple's green energy plans. The mark scheme example answers focus on specific benefits such as receiving the correct energy plan or the correct amount of energy, which are more directly beneficial to the customer. Therefore, this criterion is partially met but lacks specificity and direct linkage to the context. (0 marks)

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer does not provide linked development or specific evidence of application to Ripple's context. The response is generic and does not mention how the adjustment of products or services specifically benefits Ripple's customers in terms of their green energy needs or investment returns. The mark scheme requires linked development and evidence of application to award 2 marks, which is not present here. (0 marks)

  progression:
    - Students can progress to this level by demonstrating a basic understanding of business concepts and making simple connections between points.

    - Ripple provides green energy through its wind farm in South Wales. Therefore, they would have to pay less tax to the government on any profits made from production and supply of energy. (AO2).

  progression:
    - Students can progress to this level by providing more consistent and interconnected points and making sound evaluations.
  example_answer: 
    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  progression:
    - Students can progress to this level by demonstrating thorough and detailed understanding with logically connected reasoning and clear justifications.
  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

This leads to more revenue and Ripple being able to breakeven.","The candidate's response is brief and lacks depth. They state that Option 1 would have the most significant impact on Ripple's success because it would result in higher income due to lower taxes. However, the explanation is simplistic and does not provide a detailed application of business concepts or a thorough evaluation of the issues.

**Application (AO2):**
- The candidate makes a basic connection between lower taxes and higher income, but this is not sufficiently developed or contextualized within the specific business context of Ripple. There is no mention of how this increased income could be used to further Ripple's business objectives or how it aligns with their green energy strategy.

**Analysis (AO3a):**
- The response lacks interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning. The candidate does not explore the potential benefits or drawbacks of the option in detail, nor do they consider alternative perspectives or potential inconsistencies.

**Evaluation (AO3b):**
- The judgement provided is very simple and based on limited evaluation. The candidate does not thoroughly evaluate the business information or issues relevant to the choice made. There is no consideration of the broader implications or potential challenges Ripple might face.

Overall, this answer demonstrates a limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with minimal analysis and evaluation. It fits the criteria for Level 1.

### Marking Criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate states, ""An advantage of a PLC is that you work for people and not for the government."" This statement is incorrect and does not identify a valid advantage of starting a business as a private limited company (PLC). The mark scheme expects advantages like limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The candidate provides an example, ""For example, if someone works a pool in their garden,"" which is irrelevant and does not explain any advantage of a private limited company. The mark scheme expects explanations such as limited liability protecting personal assets or raising finance through shares. This criterion is also not met.

### Example Answers for Reference:

- ""The owners would have limited liability (1)""
- ""This means that any debts are the responsibility of the business (1)""
- ""Therefore, the personal possessions of the owners will not have to be sold to pay the debts of the business (1)""
- ""The business can sell shares to raise finance (1)""
- ""This is good because the business may have extra funds for investment (1)""
- ""This may lead to a reduction in the chance of business failure (1)""

### Marking Notes:

- The candidate's response does not align with any of the example answers or acceptable points listed in the mark scheme.
- The response does not provide a valid advantage or a relevant explanation.

### Total Marks:

- The total marks available for this question are 3.
- Given that the candidate's response does not meet any of the marking criteria, the answer should be awarded 0 marks.

### Examiner Commentary:

They would want a lot of foot traffic and like in a popular place like London but it should not matter where the business is located because you can have things delivered to your house.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one way'. The candidate has suggested a way through ""It could effect where they choose to locate because of the traffic."" This is developed through ""They would want a lot of foot traffic and like in a popular place like London,"" but the explanation is not directly related to the internet's effect on location choice. The candidate then states, ""but it should not matter where the business is located because you can have things delivered to your house,"" which indirectly touches on e-commerce but lacks clarity and direct linkage to the internet's role.

Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate mentions ""traffic"" and ""foot traffic,"" which are not directly related to the internet. Therefore, this does not satisfy the identification of a way the internet affects location choice. **No mark awarded.**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain that ""it should not matter where the business is located because you can have things delivered to your house,"" which hints at e-commerce but is not clearly articulated. The explanation is not sufficiently developed to show how the internet specifically affects the location choice. **No marks awarded.**

The candidate's response does not stay tightly focused on the question of how the internet affects location choice. The answer primarily discusses foot traffic and delivery without clearly linking these points to the internet's role.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```",The british used something called a creeping barrage and this is when you would use artillery fire as cover. This did result in some friendly casualties but it was effective. Source B shows that the lines are where the artillery fire is going to go and you can also see some shells landing right in front of them and move a few meters ahead. Source C tells us that they made a new tank called 'Whippet' and they had machine guns on the top. This tells us that tanks were a big game changer in the first World War.  ,"The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some basic analysis. For Source B, they mention the use of a ""creeping barrage"" and explain how artillery fire was used as cover, which aligns with the content of the source. For Source C, they describe the new tank called 'Whippet' and its impact on the battlefield, indicating that tanks were significant in the First World War.

However, the analysis lacks depth and detailed contextual knowledge. The student does not fully develop their evaluation of the sources' utility or provenance. To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more extended reasoning and factual knowledge, and evaluate the provenance of the sources.

breakeven = 10,0000
1,538 units","Based on the provided Question, Answer, and Mark Scheme, let's evaluate the given Answer step-by-step:

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values from the question:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's review the given Answer:
- The answer provided is:
  \[
  10,000 / 6.50 = 1538
  \]
  - This calculation is incorrect because it does not subtract the variable cost per unit from the selling price per unit before dividing the fixed costs.
- The answer also states:
  \[
  breakeven = 10,0000
  \]
  - This statement is unclear and seems to be a typographical error.
- Finally, the answer concludes with:
  \[
  1,538 units
  \]
  - This is incorrect and does not follow the correct formula.

- The student did not correctly substitute into the formula, so no mark can be awarded for the correct substitution.

- **Identification of a way:**
  - The answer identifies a way a small business could become more competitive: ""by using social media to build a following."" This satisfies the first marking criterion. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the way:**
  - The explanation provided is that using social media ""would give the small business publicity."" This partially explains how social media can help the business become more competitive.
  - The answer further explains that this helps the small business because ""other small businesses won't be in the picture because they aren't as popular."" This suggests that the business would stand out due to its popularity on social media, which is a valid point.
  - However, the explanation could be more detailed. For example, it could mention how increased publicity can lead to higher customer engagement or sales, which would make the business more competitive. The explanation is somewhat implicit but does provide a rationale.

Overall, the answer identifies a way and provides a basic explanation, but it lacks depth in explaining how social media popularity translates into competitive advantage. Given the criteria and the example answers, this response should be awarded 2 marks.

  - 3",,They will just quit because there are thousands of other businesses that need employees.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one disadvantage'. The candidate has suggested a disadvantage through 'They will just quit'. However, the explanation is not fully developed. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate identifies a disadvantage: 'They will just quit'. This satisfies the first marking criterion. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the disadvantage by stating 'because there are thousands of other businesses that need employees'. This provides some context but does not fully develop the explanation to show the impact on the business, such as increased recruitment costs or decreased productivity. The explanation is not as developed as the example answers provided in the mark scheme. **(0 marks)**

The candidate's response is partially correct but lacks a fully developed explanation. Therefore, the answer should be awarded 1 mark in total.

#### Identification of an Advantage
- **Criteria**: Identification of an advantage.
- **Evaluation**: The answer does not clearly identify an advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. Instead, it discusses a scenario where the business might need funds (""If the business gets sued or something breaks""). This does not align with the mark scheme's requirement to identify an advantage of retained profit.
- **Mark Awarded**: 0 marks.

#### Explanation of the Advantage
- **Criteria**: Explaining the advantage.
- **Evaluation**: The answer does not explain any advantage of using retained profit. It mentions potential financial needs (""you will not be able to fund it and you will have to pay out of your own pocket""), but this does not explain how retained profit is beneficial. The mark scheme expects an explanation such as ""Interest is not paid on retained profit"" or ""Retained profit does not dilute the ownership of the business,"" which is not provided here.
- **Mark Awarded**: 0 marks.

### Total Marks Awarded

And if someone does buy your product and it is not up to standard you could end up having a bad reputation and probably will not buy your product anymore and that will lead to the closing of your business.,"The candidate's response identifies a potential negative impact of adapting existing products, specifically focusing on the quality not meeting customer needs. This is a valid point and aligns with the indicative content that less innovative ideas may not fully meet changing customer needs (AO1b). The response then attempts to link this to a consequence, stating that a bad reputation could lead to customers not buying the product anymore, which could result in the business closing. This shows an attempt to deconstruct the issue and find connections between points (AO3a).

However, the response lacks detailed interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning. The analysis is somewhat superficial and does not fully explore the implications or provide a comprehensive argument. The use of business terminology is limited and not consistently accurate.

Based on the mark scheme:

- The response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with limited business terminology used (AO1b).

This satisfies the criteria of outlining a way financial information can help forecast success.

We will also consider the use of specialist terms. Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling and Punctuation
1. **Spelling:**
   - ""them countries"" should be ""those countries.""
   - ""couldve"" should be ""could've"" (contraction of ""could have"").
   - ""there alliances"" should be ""their alliances.""

2. **Punctuation:**
   - The sentence is a run-on and lacks proper punctuation. It should be broken into smaller sentences or use appropriate punctuation marks like commas and periods.
   - There is no period at the end of the sentence.

### Grammar
1. **Grammar:**
   - ""them countries"" is grammatically incorrect; it should be ""those countries.""
   - ""there alliances"" is incorrect; it should be ""their alliances.""
   - The sentence structure is somewhat awkward and could be improved for clarity.

### Use of Specialist Terms
1. **Specialist Terms:**
   - The student mentions ""Morocco crisis"" and ""Balkan crisis,"" which are relevant specialist terms related to the causes of the First World War.
   - The term ""alliances"" is also a relevant specialist term.

### Analysis
- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student has made several spelling and punctuation errors, which indicates that they do not spell and punctuate with consistent accuracy.
- **Grammar:** The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, but the errors do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student uses a limited range of specialist terms, but they are appropriate and relevant to the question.

### Conclusion
Based on the criteria in the Mark Scheme:
- The student does not meet the criteria for Level 1 (High performance) as there are multiple spelling and punctuation errors, and the grammar is not used with effective control.
- The student does not fully meet the criteria for Level 2 (Intermediate performance) due to the considerable number of spelling and punctuation errors and the general control of meaning.
- The student meets the criteria for Level 3 (Threshold performance) as they spell and punctuate with reasonable accuracy, use rules of grammar with some control of meaning, and use a limited range of specialist terms.

Given that we are a forgiving grader and looking for any excuse to place the student in a higher level, the student’s use of relevant specialist terms and the fact that the errors do not significantly hinder the overall meaning suggest that the student should be awarded the maximum mark within Level 3.

    - []","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",The impact of her non financial aims is that she is going to showcase that women can be plumbers to and she could have alot of women customers because she can relate to them unlike male plumbers.,"The candidate's response identifies a non-financial aim, which is to showcase that women can be plumbers too. This is a valid point and aligns with the indicative content that Amelia may want to gain more independence and that there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. However, the response lacks depth and detailed development.

The candidate mentions that Amelia could have a lot of women customers because she can relate to them unlike male plumbers. This point is relevant and contextual, but it is not sufficiently developed to show a detailed understanding of the impact of non-financial aims on Amelia's decision to start her business.

The response demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2). It also attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).

Therefore, the response fits the criteria for Level 1.

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula according to the Mark Scheme is: £4 000 + (£8 600 - £11 000).
   - The student starts with £4 000 and then adds £8 600 to it, which is not the correct substitution. However, they do eventually perform the correct subtraction (£12 600 - £11 000).

2. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer provided by the student is £1 600, which is correct.

Given the instructions to award marks for correct working despite the final answer being incorrect, we should consider the following:

- The student did not follow the correct formula initially but arrived at the correct final answer through their own method.
- The final answer is correct.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer provided is ""The production.""
   - According to the mark scheme, acceptable elements of the marketing mix include place, promotion, and product. ""Production"" is not one of the four Ps of the marketing mix (Product, Price, Place, Promotion).
   - Therefore, the answer does not successfully state one of the elements of the marketing mix.

### Example Answers Comparison

- The example answers provided in the mark scheme are:
  - ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham"" (1)
  - ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (1)
  - ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1)

- These examples clearly align with the elements of the marketing mix (Place, Promotion, Product). The given answer ""The production"" does not align with any of these elements.

### Marking Notes Consideration

- The marking notes specify that to award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application.
- The answer ""The production"" does not show evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. It does not refer to any specific aspect of the business or its marketing strategy.

### Conclusion

Based on the criteria and the provided context, the answer ""The production"" does not fulfill the requirement of stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd. It does not align with the acceptable elements (Product, Place, Promotion) and lacks application to the context.

#### Marking Criteria 1: Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful.
- **Criteria Fulfilled?** No.
- **Evidence from Answer:** The answer states, ""They would want her to become successful because she can be the first millionaire female plumber."" This does not outline a reason why the government would want the business to be successful. The focus is on Amelia's personal success rather than the benefits to the government.

#### Marking Criteria 2: Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.
- **Criteria Fulfilled?** No.
- **Evidence from Answer:** The answer does not provide linked points. It only mentions Amelia's potential personal success without linking it to any governmental benefits such as tax revenue or employment.

#### Example Answers Comparison:
- **Example Answer 1:** ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful (1).""
- **Example Answer 2:** ""Taxes will be based on the profits it makes from plumbing repairs (1).""
- **Example Answer 3:** ""The government will want more people to be employed (1).""
- **Example Answer 4:** ""Amelia may employ more female plumbers if the business is a success (1).""

The provided answer does not align with any of the example answers, which clearly link the business's success to benefits for the government.

#### Marking Notes:
- **Award up to 2 marks for linked points.**
- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.**

The answer does not meet the criteria for linked points and does not provide a valid reason why the government would want the business to be successful. It is focused on Amelia's personal achievement rather than the broader impact on the government or society.

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet.

For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",If she discounted only to female customers people would see it as unfair and men would not have to pay these prices. They would get it at a discounted price. So I think she should use social media to promote herself and reach on social media. It be easy this is the first or the something like this is happening.,"The candidate begins by discussing the potential negative perception of offering discounts only to female customers, which is a valid point. However, the explanation is somewhat unclear and lacks depth. The candidate then suggests using social media to promote the business, but the reasoning is vague and lacks detailed application to the business context.

**Application (AO2):** The candidate demonstrates limited application of business concepts to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. The mention of social media is relevant, but the explanation is not sufficiently developed. This places AO2 in Level 1.

**Analysis (AO3a):** The candidate attempts to deconstruct the issue but does not provide interconnected points or logical chains of reasoning. The analysis is basic and lacks depth. This places AO3a in Level 1.

**Evaluation (AO3b):** The candidate makes a judgement but provides a simple justification with minimal evaluation. The reasoning is not thorough or well-supported. This places AO3b in Level 1.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",What if it is not windy one day,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer provided is: ""What if it is not windy one day.""
   - This statement implies a risk related to the variability of wind, which could affect the energy production of the wind farm. If it is not windy, the wind farm may not generate enough energy, which could impact the return on investment for the investors.
   - According to the context, Ripple is an energy company that relies on wind energy. The variability in wind conditions is a legitimate risk for any wind energy project.
   - The mark scheme example answers include risks such as ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs,"" which is similar to the risk implied by the answer. If it is not windy, investors may not receive the expected amount of energy, which aligns with the example provided in the mark scheme.

### Conclusion:
- The answer ""What if it is not windy one day"" successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, as it highlights the potential issue of insufficient wind leading to lower energy production.
- This risk is directly related to the context of Ripple's business model, which depends on wind energy.

  - 2","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",It gives you power in your home & and every person needs that.,"**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""It gives you power in your home & and every person needs that."" This implies that customers will receive energy for their homes, which is a benefit. However, the benefit is not explicitly linked to Ripple asking questions to identify customer needs. The mark scheme requires a clear link between the benefit and the process of asking questions to identify needs.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer does not provide linked development or evidence of application. It does not explain how asking questions to identify customer needs leads to the benefit of receiving power in the home. The mark scheme example answers show that linked development is necessary, such as explaining how the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs is determined through asking questions.

- **Contextualization:**
  - The answer lacks specific context related to Ripple. It does not mention the green energy plan, investment in the wind farm, or any other specific details about Ripple's process. The context provided in the mark scheme example answers includes specific references to Ripple's services and processes.

Overall, the answer does not fully meet the criteria outlined in the mark scheme. It mentions a general benefit but lacks the necessary linked development and context.

    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

The candidate's response needs to identify a way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate and provide an explanation of this way.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate does not clearly identify a way the internet may affect the location choice of a small business. The response focuses on physical visibility and road traffic, which is not directly related to the internet. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate does not provide an explanation related to the internet's impact on business location. The explanation provided is about the ease of finding the business on a busy road versus a not busy road, which is unrelated to the internet. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

**Example Answers for Reference:**
- ""The business could choose a cheaper location (1)""
- ""This is because the business can use e-commerce (1)""
- ""As a result, the business may not require a physical retail location (1)""

**Marking Notes:**
- The candidate's response does not align with any of the example answers provided in the mark scheme.
- The response does not mention the internet or its impact on business location, thus failing to meet the criteria for identification and explanation.

**Total Marks:**
- The candidate's response does not meet any of the marking criteria. Therefore, the answer should be awarded 0 marks.

**Final Commentary:**

26,000 units","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's evaluate the given Answer step by step:

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Cost per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values from the question:
     \[
     \text{New Break-even level of output} = \frac{10,000}{6.50 - 2.50} = \frac{10,000}{4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}

   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units (original)} - 2,500 \text{ units (new)} = 1,500 \text{ units}

2. **Evaluation of the given Answer:**
   - The given Answer does not follow the correct formula or the correct steps.
   - The calculation ""10,000 ÷ 2.5 = 4,000"" is incorrect in the context of the problem.
   - The calculation ""4000 x 6.50 = 26000"" is irrelevant to finding the break-even level of output.
   - The final answer ""26,000 units"" is incorrect and does not relate to the decrease in the break-even level of output.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate states, ""Business has a lesser chance of shutting down as it is all legal."" This identifies an advantage, which is the reduced risk of the business shutting down due to legal compliance. This satisfies the first marking criterion. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The candidate does not provide further explanation of how meeting legal obligations reduces the risk of shutting down. The answer lacks development on why being legal reduces the chance of shutting down, such as avoiding fines, lawsuits, or negative publicity. The mark scheme example answers provide explanations like avoiding financial consequences or maintaining a positive image, which are missing here. Therefore, the explanation criterion is not met.

**Identification of an advantage:**
- The answer does not clearly identify an advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. The statement ""The retained profit will be used to make more money"" is too vague and does not directly address the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as being a cheap source of finance or not paying interest.

**Explaining the advantage:**
- The explanation provided, ""which leads to higher profit,"" is not sufficiently developed. It does not explain why using retained profit specifically leads to higher profit, nor does it connect to any of the detailed advantages in the mark scheme, such as avoiding interest payments or maintaining control of the business.

### Marking Notes

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer does not directly outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. Instead, it mentions that being ""fully legal and pay taxes"" helps get more customers, which is not directly related to financial forecasting. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The statement ""helps them get more customers as they are fully legal and pay taxes etc."" does not provide a clear link to how financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked and the answer does not directly address how financial information in a business plan could help forecast success, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. However, even for 1 mark, the answer should at least mention some aspect of financial information, which it does not.

  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).
  - As a result, she would be determined to succeed as there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. This could give her an extra incentive to do well. (AO3a).
  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

    - []","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","She was training to become a plumber 6 years ago then move to a building company, this means she has experience a practice","The candidate's response is very limited and does not address the question adequately. The answer merely states that Amelia was training to become a plumber six years ago and then moved to a building company, indicating she has experience. However, this does not analyze the impact of non-financial aims on Amelia's decision to start Lili Heating Ltd.

There is no application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2). The response does not attempt to deconstruct business information or issues, nor does it find any connections between points (AO3a).

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula is: £4 000 + (£8 600 - £11 000)
   - The student has used: 8600 + 4000 = 12600 and then 12600 - 11000 = 1600

   The student has not directly substituted into the correct formula but has rearranged the terms in a way that still leads to the correct final calculation. This shows an understanding of the arithmetic involved.

2. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer provided is £1600, which is correct.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- The student has demonstrated the correct working, even though it was not in the exact form expected.
- The final answer is correct.

Therefore, I would award the following marks:

- 1 mark for the correct working (despite the rearrangement).
- 1 mark for the correct final answer.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer ""Quality"" does not directly state one of the traditional elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, or Price). The elements of the marketing mix are typically defined as Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. Quality can be considered an aspect of the Product element, but it is not explicitly one of the four Ps.
   - The mark scheme examples include ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham,"" ""Promotion methods to attract female customers,"" and ""Product is to repair/install boilers."" These examples clearly align with the traditional elements of the marketing mix.
   - Therefore, the answer ""Quality"" does not satisfy this criterion as it does not explicitly state one of the elements of the marketing mix.

### Marking Notes Evaluation

- **To award 1 mark there must be evidence of application.**
  - The answer ""Quality"" does not provide evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd. It does not mention how quality is related to the business context provided, such as the specific services offered, the target market, or the unique selling point.
  - The context mentions that Amelia aims to provide high-quality work to encourage customer recommendations, but the answer does not explicitly connect ""Quality"" to any of the marketing mix elements in a way that shows application.

### Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, the answer ""Quality"" does not meet the criteria for stating one element of the marketing mix and does not provide evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd. Therefore, no marks should be awarded.

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer does not provide a clear, linked reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. The statement ""So she can make house values go up"" is not directly linked to the government's interest. The mark scheme examples suggest reasons such as tax collection or employment, which are more directly related to government interests. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The answer does not link the point to the government's interest. It is a standalone statement without development or context. Therefore, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

The answer does not provide a linked reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful, nor does it develop the point in a way that connects it to the government's interests. The response is generic and lacks the necessary context and linkage.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Sources B and C could be very useful to a historian. This is because Source A shows us a creeping barrage. This is a fine example of both military technology and tactics. 

The creeping barrage displays how good and effective the artillery fire was. It was very accurate and hard to see although some men lost their lives due to missplaced shells. The creeping barrage is a good show of tactics as allied soldiers would slowly move forward while covered by the rain of artillery fire just in front of them, the smoke and dirt from explosions keeping them hidden. 

Another reason these sources are useful is Source C is written just after the war by a soldier, who was himself part of a tank battle. This makes the source reliable because the account wasn't slightly forgotten or changed from being passed on through stories and similar things. The account was also written straight after the war had finished meaning it's all still very fresh and accurate when writing the account.

Source c also talks about the newest and fastest tank the ""whippets"", this is an example of military technology advancements but also tactics changing.

As source c talks about several of the tanks coming at once to save him. However before the tanks were sent out in ones and twos and very easily picked off. So we can see from source c that tank tactics took a big change for the better. ","The student begins by identifying relevant features of Source B, explaining the concept of a creeping barrage and its significance in terms of military technology and tactics. They describe how the artillery fire was used to cover advancing soldiers, highlighting the accuracy and effectiveness of this tactic. This demonstrates a good understanding of the content of Source B and its relevance to the question.

In the second paragraph, the student evaluates Source C, noting that it was written by a soldier who participated in the events described. They argue that this makes the source reliable, as it was written shortly after the war and is based on first-hand experience. The student also mentions the introduction of the ""Whippets"" tanks, linking this to advancements in military technology and changes in tactics.

The student effectively uses contextual knowledge to support their analysis, explaining how tank tactics evolved during the war. They note that tanks were initially sent out in small numbers and were easily picked off, but later tactics involved deploying multiple tanks simultaneously, which proved more effective.

Overall, the student provides a developed evaluation of both sources, using extended reasoning and contextual knowledge to explain their utility. However, the evaluation of the provenance of Source B could be more explicit, and the relationship between the sources could be explored further to reach the highest level.

Overall, this answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 8 marks.

The Germans eventually made it through Belgium however they did get slowed down behind schedule. This gave France time to prepare but maybe not quite enough time as Germany still made massive advancements into France, and even got a couple of tens of kilometers away from Paris. 

After the Germans got pushed back a bit by Allied soldiers, they decided to dig in. They took high ground and built very permanent trenches. This was a problem for France because the Germans had no plans of leaving.

 This also lead to the race to the sea, where the enemys battled it out to have the best trench positions where eventually they had reached the sea after digging 400 miles of trenches.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond basic statements. The answer identifies key events such as the German advance through Belgium, the involvement of Britain, and the subsequent trench warfare.

However, the analysis remains relatively simple and lacks the depth and range of accurate knowledge required for Level 3. The student mentions the delay caused by Belgian resistance and the subsequent trench warfare but does not develop these points with detailed factual knowledge or complex reasoning. The explanation of how these events led to problems is also somewhat brief and lacks the developed sequencing and reasoning needed for higher levels.

To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide a more detailed and well-ordered narrative, explaining how each stage of the Schlieffen Plan's failure led to increased tension and stalemate. For example, they could discuss the impact of the Battle of the Marne and how the need to send troops east to face Russia affected the German advance.

The student mentions the feeling of encirclement experienced by Germany and the subsequent formation of the Triple Alliance. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge, such as the specific dates or the broader context of European rivalries.

The second paragraph attempts to explain another factor, the Moroccan Crises, but the explanation is somewhat unclear and lacks coherence. The student mentions the involvement of Britain, France, and Germany in Morocco but does not provide a clear, structured explanation of how this incident contributed to the tensions leading to the war. The mention of ""dreadnought boats"" is relevant but not well-explained in the context of the naval arms race between Britain and Germany.

With Britain bringing new dreadnought boats and destroying German control of that bit of sea.","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's analyze the student's answer step-by-step to determine the appropriate level and marks to award.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are some errors:
     - ""World War one"" should be ""World War One"" or ""World War I.""
     - ""triple entente"" should be ""Triple Entente.""
     - ""triple alliance"" should be ""Triple Alliance.""
     - ""Moroco"" should be ""Morocco.""
     - ""boats"" should be ""ships"" for better terminology.
   - Punctuation errors include:
     - ""by this he formed"" should be ""By this, he formed.""
     - ""however Italy"" should be ""However, Italy.""
     - ""they switch sides"" should be ""they switched sides.""
     - ""Britain + France"" should be ""Britain and France.""
     - ""would would"" is a repetition error and should be ""would.""
     - ""This lead to"" should be ""This led to.""

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly but with some errors:
     - ""When the German Kaiser saw the triple entente to be formed"" should be ""When the German Kaiser saw the Triple Entente being formed.""
     - ""he didn't have a choice but to retaliate"" should be ""he had no choice but to retaliate.""
     - ""they switch sides"" should be ""they switched sides.""
     - ""This lead to a battle in Moroco"" should be ""This led to a battle in Morocco.""

3. **Control of Meaning:**
   - Despite the errors, the overall meaning of the student's response is clear and understandable.
   - The student effectively communicates the idea that the alliance systems contributed to the tensions leading to World War I.

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Triple Entente,"" ""Triple Alliance,"" ""dreadnought,"" and ""colonise.""
   - However, the range of specialist terms is not particularly wide.

### Conclusion:

- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy but has several errors.
- **Grammar:** The student uses grammar with some control of meaning, and errors do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student uses a limited range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme, the student's performance aligns most closely with **Level 3**. However, as a forgiving grader, I note that the errors do not severely hinder the meaning, and the student has made a reasonable attempt to use specialist terms.

### Final Marks Awarded:
- **Level 3: 1 mark**

The student should be awarded 1 mark for their response.",3,1,4,3.0,2.0,False,0.0,0.4444444444444444,,,,,8.973258018493652,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 671, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.003355, 'completion_tokens': 590, 'completion_cost': 0.00885, 'total_cost': 0.012205}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 628, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.00314, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.003155}"

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```",Source B is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics during the First World War. For instance it shows a 'Artillery Barrage' where the Artillery behind the trench would fire over the trench to protect Running Soldiers as a line of defence. They would time 4 minutes between each so by when they had reached the trench they would use bayonets. Source C is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics during the First World War. For instance it says about 'tank warfare' which was a military technology It was first used in the 'Battle of the Somme' where it had failed however they using it effectively in the 'Battle of Cambrai' where they would line with 300 tanks progress moving at around 5mph. This would act as a defence it would of then reached the trench where it would destroy Barbed wire. Then they would go in trench using hand combat. In Conclusion Source C and Source B both are useful to describing techniques and warfare tactics.,"The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some factual knowledge to support their analysis. For Source B, they describe the artillery barrage and its purpose, and for Source C, they discuss tank warfare and its development. However, the evaluation of the sources' utility is quite basic and lacks depth. The student does not fully explore the provenance of the sources or how this affects their usefulness to a historian. 

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources. For example, they could discuss how Source B, being a picture published in a British newspaper in 1917, might have been intended to boost public morale and support for the war effort, and how this might affect its reliability. Similarly, they could evaluate Source C by considering the author's background as a tank commander and the fact that it was published after the war, which might influence its perspective and accuracy.

Overall, this answer falls into Level 2 due to its simple evaluation of the content and some factual knowledge. To achieve Level 3 or 4, the student would need to provide more developed evaluation and extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources based on both content and provenance.

Belgium and Britain has a treaty called 'Treaty of London' where if Belgium got attacked Britain would defend. So once Germany had got into France they had to fight Britain and France. This had then further led on to the Battle of Marne where Germany were beat again.","The student identifies the initial problem caused by the Schlieffen Plan, which was Germany's invasion of Belgium and the subsequent involvement of Britain due to the Treaty of London. This demonstrates a basic understanding of causation and consequence, moving the answer beyond level 1. However, the answer lacks depth and detail, providing only a brief overview of events without further explanation or specific factual knowledge.

To reach level 2, the student would need to provide a more structured account with specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question.

In conclusion I agree to a certain extent that the alliance system was the main cause that that had led to WWI.","To assess the student's answer, we will evaluate it against the criteria provided in the Mark Scheme for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG). We will also consider the use of specialist terms.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, including more complex terms like ""annexed,"" ""Schlieffen plan,"" and ""treaty.""
   - There are minor punctuation errors, such as the repeated word ""that"" in the conclusion: ""the alliance system was the main cause that that had led to WWI.""
   - The use of quotation marks around 'Alliance system' and 'blank cheque' is appropriate and correctly punctuated.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are a few awkward constructions and minor errors:
     - ""Austria getting Germany's help"" could be more clearly phrased as ""Austria sought Germany's help.""
     - ""step foot in Belgium"" should be ""set foot in Belgium.""
   - Despite these minor issues, the overall meaning is clear and not significantly hindered by grammatical errors.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Alliance system,"" ""annexed,"" ""blank cheque,"" ""Schlieffen plan,"" and ""treaty.""
   - These terms are relevant to the topic and demonstrate a good understanding of the subject matter.

### Conclusion:
- The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though not with consistent accuracy.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, despite some minor errors.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best within **Level 2**. The minor errors in grammar and punctuation prevent it from reaching Level 1, but the overall control of meaning and use of specialist terms are strong enough to place it in the higher end of Level 2.

The candidate has suggested a disadvantage through 'the employee is likely to leave the business as they aren't being paid on time'. This is developed through 'this means that there are less employees in the business'. However, the candidate does not further develop their answer to explain the implications of having fewer employees. 

Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate identifies a disadvantage: 'the employee is likely to leave the business as they aren't being paid on time'. This satisfies the first marking criterion. **1 mark awarded.**

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate begins to explain the disadvantage by stating 'this means that there are less employees in the business'. This partially explains the consequence of employees leaving but does not fully develop the explanation to show the broader impact on the business, such as increased recruitment costs or difficulties in managing operations. According to the mark scheme, a full explanation should include further implications, similar to the example answers provided. **1 mark awarded for partial explanation.**

Overall, the candidate's response is clear and focused on the question but lacks a fully developed explanation of the disadvantage's broader impact on the business.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""they won't owe anyone any amount of money."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying an advantage, as it implies that the business does not incur debt. Therefore, 1 mark should be awarded for this identification.

- **Explaining the advantage:**
  - The explanation is provided through ""so they won't be required to pay it back to anyone with possible interest meaning they lose money."" This explanation aligns with the example answer ""Interest is not paid on retained profit"" and ""The business would not experience an increase in costs."" The candidate has clearly explained that not having to pay interest means the business does not lose money, which is a valid explanation of the advantage.

This aligns with the indicative content point that adapting existing products may not be as innovative and may not fully meet changing customer needs (AO1b, AO3a).

This aligns with the indicative content point that adapting existing products can take less time and creative input and can provide a competitive advantage if it meets customer needs (AO1b, AO3a).

  - Using the internet as a source of secondary market research is a fast and convenient way to discover how many females live in Birmingham (AO2).
  - The internet will not provide focused information to let Amelia know if there will be enough demand for her plumbing and building services (AO2).
  - Although she knows how many females live in Birmingham, it would be difficult to find out how many of them own a property or would want a female plumber to work in their homes (AO3a).
  - Lili Heating Ltd will be in competition against other established plumbers. Amelia will need to spend more time developing her target market to make sure there are enough potential customers (AO3a).

Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Because Lili Heating Ltd used the internet for secondary research, the research she has found may not be specific to her business or customer target so she could be using the wrong information. So she could lose money as she hasn't got the correct information for her business.

Also if she uses market research, the information she gathers could be out of date and no longer applied for her business idea. This means that she could be looking at information that doesn't include new businesses in her target market.","The candidate identifies two potential impacts of using the internet for secondary market research. The first impact is that the research ""may not be specific to her business or customer target,"" which is developed through ""she could be using the wrong information"" and further developed with ""she could lose money as she hasn't got the correct information for her business."" The second impact is that the information ""could be out of date,"" which is developed through ""no longer applied for her business idea"" and further developed with ""she could be looking at information that doesn't include new businesses in her target market.""

In terms of AO2 (Application), the response includes some contextual elements such as ""Lili Heating Ltd,"" ""her business,"" and ""customer target."" However, the application is not detailed and lacks specific references to the context provided, such as Amelia's unique selling point or the competitive environment in Birmingham.

For AO3a (Analysis), the response attempts to deconstruct the issue by identifying potential problems with using secondary market research from the internet. However, the chains of reasoning are relatively simple and lack depth. The response does not fully explore the implications or provide detailed interconnected points.

Based on the mark scheme:
- The response shows limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the business context (AO2).
- The response attempts to deconstruct business information and issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).

  - This example clearly states ""Promotion"" as the element of the marketing mix and provides context-specific information.
- **Example Answer 3:** ""Product is to repair/install boilers (1)""
  - This example clearly states ""Product"" as the element of the marketing mix and provides context-specific information.

### Marking Notes

- **To award 1 mark there must be evidence of application.**

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer provides a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful: ""she is filling a gap in the market."" This is a valid point as it suggests that the business is addressing an unmet need, which can contribute to economic growth.
  - The answer also links this to the government collecting more tax: ""she will make lots of revenue that the government can tax."" This linkage is clear and directly addresses the marking criteria.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are linked. The candidate connects the success of the business in filling a market gap to the generation of revenue and subsequent tax collection by the government. Therefore, the answer should not be limited to 1 mark.

- **Example Answers:**
  - The answer aligns well with the example answers provided in the mark scheme. It mentions the government collecting more tax due to the business's success, similar to the example: ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful.""

- **Award any other valid answer. To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer provides linked development by explaining that filling a market gap will lead to increased revenue and tax collection. However, it lacks specific contextual evidence from the provided context about Amelia's unique selling point or her business plan.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The answer successfully outlines a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful and links it to tax collection.
- However, it lacks specific contextual evidence from the context provided, such as Amelia's unique selling point or her business plan details.

Also if she uses social media to advertise it is a lot easier and more accessible for people rather than other methods of advertisement. This means she is more likely to have customers as more people are aware of her business.","The candidate begins by stating that Lili Heating Ltd should choose option B, which is to use social media for advertising. They provide some application (AO2) by mentioning that online advertising is free and that it can help reach a wider range of consumers. However, the application is limited and lacks depth, as it does not fully explore the business context or the specific needs of Lili Heating Ltd.

The analysis (AO3a) is basic and lacks interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The candidate mentions that social media is easier and more accessible for people, but does not provide a detailed explanation or explore potential drawbacks or other considerations.

The evaluation (AO3b) is minimal, with a simple judgement that social media advertising is beneficial because it is free and accessible. There is no thorough evaluation of the business information or issues relevant to the choice made.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited understanding of the business scenario and provides a simple judgement with minimal justification. This places the answer in Level 1.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",The business is trying to be the cheapest supplier for energy so the quality of the wind turbines could be bad meaning no energy is made.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria and the context provided.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

#### Criteria: Stating one risk for investors in Ripple

- **Evaluation**: The answer states, ""the quality of the wind turbines could be bad meaning no energy is made."" This implies a risk that the wind turbines may not function properly, leading to a failure in energy production. This is a valid risk for investors as it directly impacts the return on their investment.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1**: ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" - This example directly states a financial risk.
- **Example Answer 2**: ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs"" - This example focuses on the risk of insufficient energy supply.
- **Example Answer 3**: ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy"" - This example highlights a market demand risk.

The given answer aligns most closely with Example Answer 2, as it implies that poor quality wind turbines could result in no energy being produced, thereby affecting the energy supply to investors' homes or businesses.

### Marking Notes Evaluation

- **Application Evidence**: The answer must show evidence of application to the context of Ripple. The answer mentions ""the quality of the wind turbines could be bad,"" which is relevant to Ripple's business model of generating energy through wind farms. This shows an understanding of the specific risks associated with Ripple's operations.

### Final Mark Allocation

- **Total Marks Available**: 1
- **Marks Awarded**: 1

The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple by stating that poor quality wind turbines could result in no energy being produced. This is a valid risk and is supported by the context of Ripple's business model.

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","Option 2 is better for Ripple as renewable energy methods are fairly new so new employees are less likely to know what they are doing so will struggle to complete their job. So if the Government pays to train them it is easier and cheaper for Ripple to hire new employees.

Also, if the business has trained staff, they won't need to try and hire staff without training meaning they won't break any laws in the employment laws, so they won't be fined, meaning they save money and their reputation as a business.

Also if the government pays for training the business can hire more people as they won't have to pay for training making it easier to manage the business and make it less likely that they are understaffed and can't run the business it could be dangerous.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 is better for Ripple, which is a clear judgement. They provide some reasoning by discussing the novelty of renewable energy methods and the potential struggle for new employees without training. This demonstrates some application of knowledge (AO2) and attempts to deconstruct the issue (AO3a). However, the explanation lacks depth and interconnected points, which limits the analysis.

The candidate then mentions the legal implications of hiring untrained staff and the potential fines, which adds some context and evaluation (AO3b). This point is relevant but not fully developed, as it does not explore the broader impact on the business.

Finally, the candidate discusses the benefits of government-funded training in terms of hiring more staff and managing the business effectively. This point is relevant but again lacks detailed interconnected reasoning and thorough evaluation.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the business concepts and issues, with some application to the context of Ripple. However, the analysis and evaluation are limited and not fully developed.

  example_answer: 
    - 'the success of the Schlieffen Plan depended on the speed of its execution but the Germans failed to defeat France within the planned timescale of 6 weeks. The Germans underestimated the resolve and reaction times of its enemies. However, whilst the Germans were not successful in their primary objective, neither were they entirely defeated.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""Briton"" should be ""Britain.""
     - ""Britan"" should be ""Britain.""
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some issues:
     - The sentence ""We know that the Triple Alliance and the Entente Alliance did form tension Triple Alliance contained of Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary and the Entente Alliance contained of Briton, France, Russia."" is a run-on sentence and lacks proper punctuation.
     - The phrase ""Additional towards this made Britan and Germany very much tensions."" is awkwardly phrased and lacks clarity.
     - The sentence ""However I don’t believe the Alliance System was the main cause of WW1, and I think when Austria-Hungary attacked on Serbia and had the back up of Germany on the Austria-Hungary side, this caused the most tensions and Alliance further to follow down the line."" is also a run-on sentence and could benefit from better punctuation.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses grammar with general control of meaning overall, but there are some issues:
     - ""Triple Alliance contained of Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary and the Entente Alliance contained of Briton, France, Russia."" should be ""The Triple Alliance consisted of Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary, while the Entente Alliance consisted of Britain, France, and Russia.""
     - ""Additional towards this made Britan and Germany very much tensions."" is grammatically incorrect and unclear.
     - ""I think when Austria-Hungary attacked on Serbia and had the back up of Germany on the Austria-Hungary side, this caused the most tensions and Alliance further to follow down the line."" is awkwardly phrased and could be clearer.

3. **Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""Triple Alliance,"" ""Entente Alliance,"" ""Germany,"" ""Italy,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" ""Britain,"" ""France,"" ""Russia,"" ""WW1,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" ""Serbia,"" and ""German empire.""
   - The use of these terms is appropriate and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic.

**Conclusion:**
- The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though there are some errors.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, but there are some awkward phrases and run-on sentences.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

The candidate has suggested an advantage through 'You get independence and more money to yourself'.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate mentions 'You get independence and more money to yourself'. This is not a clear identification of an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The mark scheme expects advantages like 'limited liability' or 'ability to sell shares to raise finance'. Therefore, this part of the answer does not satisfy the criteria. **(0 marks)**

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The candidate attempts to explain by stating 'because the amount of money isn't shared'. This explanation is vague and does not clearly relate to the advantages of a private limited company as outlined in the mark scheme. The mark scheme expects explanations such as 'debts are the responsibility of the business' or 'extra funds for investment'. Therefore, this part of the answer does not satisfy the criteria. **(0 marks)**

The candidate has suggested a way through ""it might not come up on google maps or safari"" and this is developed through ""so you can't travel there."" However, the response lacks clarity and does not fully align with the marking criteria. Let's break down the response according to the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:
  - The candidate mentions that the business ""might not come up on google maps or safari,"" which can be interpreted as a way the internet affects the business's visibility. This partially identifies a way but is not clearly articulated in terms of location choice. 
  - **Partial credit**: The identification is vague and not directly related to the location choice. 

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:
  - The candidate attempts to explain the consequence of not appearing on Google Maps or Safari by stating ""so you can't travel there."" This suggests that the business's location might be harder to find, but it does not clearly explain how this affects the choice of location.
  - **No credit**: The explanation is not sufficiently developed to show how the internet affects the choice of location.

The candidate's response does not fully meet the criteria for a clear identification and explanation of how the internet affects where a small business chooses to locate. The response is too vague and lacks the necessary detail to be awarded full marks.

Answer: 1,500 units (1)",,4000 - 150 = 3850 units,"To grade the provided answer, let's break down the steps according to the mark scheme and see if any partial credit can be awarded for correct working.

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{New break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's evaluate the given answer:

- The provided answer is ""4000 - 150 = 3850 units.""
- This answer does not show the correct substitution into the formula.
- The final answer of 3850 units is incorrect and does not match the expected decrease of 1,500 units.

Given the mark scheme, we can award marks for correct working even if the final answer is incorrect. However, in this case, the provided answer does not demonstrate any correct working or partial steps that align with the mark scheme.

**Grading:**
- Substitution into the correct formula: 0 marks (no correct substitution shown)
- Correct calculation of the decrease: 0 marks (incorrect final answer and no correct intermediate steps)

The candidate's response does not address the question directly and does not align with the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme. Let's evaluate the response against each marking criterion:

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate does not identify an advantage related to meeting legal obligations. Instead, they discuss increasing price and quality and taking risks with more expensive products. This does not align with the requirement to identify an advantage of meeting legal obligations.
  - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - Since the candidate did not identify an appropriate advantage, there is no relevant explanation provided. The discussion about gaining profit from increasing prices and quality is unrelated to the question about legal obligations.
  - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

### Example Answers Comparison:
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme focus on avoiding legal consequences, maintaining a positive image, and motivating employees. The candidate's response does not touch on any of these points or any other relevant advantage of meeting legal obligations.

### Conclusion:
- The candidate's response does not meet any of the marking criteria. It does not identify an advantage of meeting legal obligations, nor does it provide an explanation related to the question.

The candidate's response needs to identify a disadvantage and then explain it in detail. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate does not clearly identify a specific disadvantage related to not paying employees on time. Instead, they discuss a potential cause of financial difficulty (""not enough customers coming in and buying things"") and its impact on the business's ability to pay employees. This does not directly address the disadvantage to the business of not paying employees on time.
  - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate explains that the business might struggle to pay employees due to insufficient profit (""so the business won't make enough profit so it will be hard paying them back if they haven't got as much money consumed""). However, this explanation is more about the cause of the problem rather than the disadvantage itself.
  - The response does not explain the consequences of not paying employees on time, such as decreased motivation, increased turnover, or higher recruitment costs.
  - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

### Example Answers Comparison:
- The example answers clearly identify a disadvantage (e.g., employees wanting to leave or decreased motivation) and then explain the consequences (e.g., increased recruitment costs or problems meeting customer orders). The candidate's response does not follow this structure and fails to identify and explain a specific disadvantage.

### Examiner Commentary:
- The candidate's response does not meet the requirements of the marking criteria. They do not clearly identify a disadvantage of not paying employees on time, nor do they provide a detailed explanation of the consequences of this action. Instead, the response focuses on a potential cause of financial difficulty, which is not directly relevant to the question.

- **Explaining the advantage**: The candidate does not fully explain how having money stored and backed up benefits the business.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success.**
  - The answer states, ""To help her forecast the potential success of the business and to see if she would need an overdraft."" This is a valid point but lacks specific financial information such as cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis. Therefore, it does not fully outline a way financial information could help forecast success. This criterion is not fully satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks.**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The response mentions forecasting success and the need for an overdraft but does not connect these points to specific financial information or tools. This criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark.**
  - Since the points are not linked and the answer lacks specific financial information, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide specific financial tools such as cash-flow forecasts and break-even analysis, which are linked to how they help forecast success. The given answer does not provide such specifics.

**Marking Notes:**
- The marking notes emphasize the need for linked development and evidence of application to award 2 marks. The given answer does not meet this requirement.

**Total Marks:**
- The total marks for this question are 2. Given the lack of specific financial information and linked points, the answer should be awarded 1 mark.

Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet.

The answer mentions that using the internet can help Amelia find more ideas and tactics to grow her business, which is a valid point. However, it does not provide any specific details or examples related to Lili Heating Ltd or the context provided. The response also briefly mentions the risk of listening to wrong advice, but again, this point is not developed or linked to the specific context of Amelia's business.

The response does not demonstrate a sound application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2). It also fails to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).

Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",Product because she needs to have the right equipment to fix or repair the problem.,"Let's evaluate the Answer against the Mark Scheme criteria:

### Marking Criteria

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**

   - **Evaluation:** The Answer states ""Product"" as the element of the marketing mix. This is one of the four Ps of the marketing mix (Product, Price, Place, Promotion), so it satisfies this criterion.

### Example Answers

- **Example Answer 1:** ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham (1)""
  - **Comparison:** The example answer specifies ""Place"" and provides context about distributing services to customer homes in Birmingham. The Answer specifies ""Product"" and provides context about having the right equipment to fix or repair the problem. Both answers correctly identify an element of the marketing mix and provide some context.

- **Example Answer 2:** ""Promotion methods to attract female customers (1)""
  - **Comparison:** This example specifies ""Promotion"" and provides context about attracting female customers. The Answer specifies ""Product"" and provides context about having the right equipment. Both answers correctly identify an element of the marketing mix and provide some context.

- **Example Answer 3:** ""Product is to repair/install boilers (1)""
  - **Comparison:** This example specifies ""Product"" and provides context about repairing/installing boilers. The Answer specifies ""Product"" and provides context about having the right equipment to fix or repair the problem. Both answers correctly identify an element of the marketing mix and provide relevant context.

### Marking Notes

- **To award 1 mark there must be evidence of application.**
  - **Evaluation:** The Answer provides evidence of application by mentioning the need for the right equipment to fix or repair the problem, which is relevant to the context of Amelia starting her own plumbing business.

### Conclusion

The Answer successfully states one element of the marketing mix (""Product"") and provides relevant context (""she needs to have the right equipment to fix or repair the problem""). This aligns with the example answers and the marking notes.

Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",Because she will be one of the few female plumbers that have become successful and will be a big achievement.,"**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer states, ""she will be one of the few female plumbers that have become successful and will be a big achievement."" This is a valid point but lacks a clear link to why the government would want the business to be successful. The answer does not explicitly mention any benefits to the government, such as increased tax revenue or employment opportunities. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked to the government's perspective. The response focuses on Amelia's success as a female plumber, which is an achievement but does not directly address why the government would want her business to succeed. Hence, this criterion is satisfied, and the answer can be awarded 1 mark for an unlinked point.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers in the mark scheme provide clear reasons why the government would want the business to be successful, such as increased tax revenue or employment opportunities. The given answer does not provide such a reason, making it less comprehensive.

**Marking Notes:**
- The marking notes specify that to award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. The given answer does not meet this requirement as it lacks a clear link to the government's perspective.

**Total Marks:**
- The total marks for this question are 2. Given that the answer does not provide linked points and lacks a clear reason from the government's perspective, it should be awarded 1 mark.

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","I think option 2 will be the best for Lili Heating Ltd because it is more noticeable and can grow quicker because everybody can see the results of the work and how good it is if she posts on social media often and then both female and male customers would want to have Lili Heating Ltd doing their plumbing. She should also post it on social media because she can earn money from it by just posting photos or videos and it getting a lot of likes and follows. And when it becomes bigger eventually it can go on tv adverts. If she chooses to offer a discounted price to female customers, she will only attract female customers and not many male ones and she won't share it on any social medias for it to get noticed and eventually will run out of female customers and have nobody to go to and can't get paid. So that's why she should go with option 2.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 is the best choice for Lili Heating Ltd. They provide some reasoning for this choice, mentioning that social media can help the business grow quickly and attract both male and female customers. This demonstrates some application of business concepts to the context (AO2), but the application is not detailed and lacks depth. The candidate also mentions that social media can generate income through likes and follows, which is a valid point but not fully developed.

The analysis (AO3a) is limited and somewhat superficial. The candidate does not provide interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. They mention that social media can lead to TV adverts eventually, but this point is not well-explained or connected to the overall argument. The disadvantages of Option 1 are mentioned, but the reasoning is simplistic and lacks depth.

The evaluation (AO3b) is present but limited. The candidate makes a judgement that Option 2 is better because it can attract a wider customer base and generate income through social media. However, the justification is based on limited evaluation and lacks thoroughness.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context, with basic analysis and a simple judgement. This places the answer in Level 1.

    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",Provide free training because it will encourage people because its free.,"The candidate's answer is very brief and lacks depth. It suggests that providing free training will encourage people because it is free, but does not elaborate on how this would impact Ripple's success. 

**Application of Knowledge and Understanding (AO2):**
- The answer shows a very limited application of business concepts to the context of Ripple. There is no detailed explanation of how free training would benefit Ripple specifically, nor is there any mention of the company's context or the green energy sector.

**Deconstruction of Business Information and Issues (AO3a):**
- The answer does not deconstruct any business information or issues. There are no interconnected points or chains of reasoning. The statement is too simplistic and lacks any logical development.

**Judgement and Justification (AO3b):**
- The judgement is very basic and lacks any substantial justification. The candidate does not evaluate the impact of free training on Ripple's success or compare it to the other option.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 1 due to its limited application of knowledge, lack of deconstruction of business information, and simple justification.

```","Source A doesn't show you much but it shows that you can be betrayed by the people you trust the most. However, Source B shows soldiers coming from the sea but being hidden from artillery, blowing up in front of them. This acts as a defense if they let the bomb blow more forward and carry that on then the explosion will keep them cover. ","The student's response demonstrates a basic understanding of the sources but lacks depth and accuracy. The analysis of Source A is incorrect as it does not relate to the content of the source provided. The student misinterprets the source, which actually shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage, not betrayal.

For Source B, the student correctly identifies that it shows soldiers advancing under artillery cover but does not provide a detailed explanation or contextual knowledge to support this observation. The explanation is vague and lacks the necessary detail to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the source's utility.

To improve, the student should focus on accurately describing the content of the sources and providing relevant contextual knowledge. They should also evaluate the provenance of the sources to explain their usefulness to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

The candidate has suggested an advantage through 'the risk is reduced because you can't have your personal stuff took of you as debt'. This is developed through 'you only can lose the money you invested and can't be fined personally'. The candidate's response has stayed focused on the question. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage**: The candidate identifies an advantage by stating, ""the risk is reduced because you can't have your personal stuff took of you as debt."" This aligns with the example answer, ""The owners would have limited liability."" Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the identified advantage**: The candidate explains the identified advantage by stating, ""you only can lose the money you invested and can't be fined personally."" This explanation is similar to the example answer, ""Therefore, the personal possessions of the owners will not have to be sold to pay the debts of the business."" The candidate has effectively explained why limited liability is an advantage. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. **(2 marks)**

Therefore the business making more revenue and income.","This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one way'. The candidate has suggested a way through 'A business might be set up in a location with good views'. This is developed through 'this attracts more people it use it on the internet with more people increases the likelihood of them buying into that business'. The candidate then further develops their answer with 'Therefore the business making more revenue and income'. 

Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:
  - The candidate identifies a way: 'A business might be set up in a location with good views'. This is a valid point, although it is not directly related to the internet affecting the location choice. The mark scheme examples focus on e-commerce and internet connectivity, but the candidate's point about attracting more people through good views can be considered a valid interpretation. Award 1 mark.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:
  - The candidate explains that 'this attracts more people it use it on the internet with more people increases the likelihood of them buying into that business'. This explanation is somewhat unclear and does not directly link to how the internet affects the location choice. The candidate seems to be mixing the concept of physical attractiveness with internet usage, which is not clearly articulated.
  - The further development 'Therefore the business making more revenue and income' is an attempt to explain the benefit but does not clearly tie back to the internet's role in location choice. The explanation lacks clarity and coherence in linking the internet to the location decision.

Given the lack of clear linkage to the internet's role in affecting the location choice, the explanation does not fully satisfy the criteria for the additional marks.

Overall, the answer should be awarded 1 mark for identifying a way, but no additional marks for the explanation due to lack of clarity and direct relevance to the internet's impact on location choice.

- The answer identifies a disadvantage: ""If a small business doesn't pay their employees on time, they are likely to quit."" This satisfies the first marking criterion by clearly stating a disadvantage.

**Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**

- The answer explains the disadvantage further: ""If your employees quit you'll have to replace them which can be difficult."" This aligns with the example answer in the mark scheme: ""This means the business may have to find new employees,"" and thus earns 1 mark for explanation.
  
- The answer continues to develop the explanation: ""More people will leave and you'll have no one to work for you which can decrease revenue and because the business is small it can go into debt."" This part of the answer explains the potential consequences of employees quitting, which is similar to the example answer: ""This may increase the recruitment costs of the business."" Therefore, this earns the final mark for a well-developed explanation.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""A small business using retained profit is an advantage because a business won't have to go into debt or loan."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying an advantage, as it highlights the avoidance of debt.

- **Explaining the advantage:**
  - The explanation is provided through, ""which will make it risky and because you have to pay interest."" This part of the answer explains why avoiding debt is advantageous, as it reduces risk and avoids interest payments. This aligns with the example answer, ""Interest is not paid on retained profit.""
  - Further explanation is given with, ""Retained profit means you don't need to pay or spend more money because you're using the money you make."" This reinforces the idea that retained profit is a self-sustaining source of finance, which avoids additional costs. This aligns with the example answer, ""The business would not experience an increase in costs.""

Overall, the answer successfully identifies and explains the advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. The candidate has provided a clear and focused response that meets the criteria outlined in the mark scheme.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""Financial information in can help in Lili Heating Ltd can help her know how much revenue she needs to make for the business to survive."" This outlines a way financial information can help forecast success by indicating the necessary revenue for business survival. This satisfies the criteria.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer continues with, ""doing this keeps her on track and reduces the risk this makes it so she knows if she needs an overdraft or not."" This links the initial point about revenue to the benefits of staying on track and reducing risk, and ultimately knowing if an overdraft is needed. This linked development satisfies the criteria for awarding up to 2 marks.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - The points in the answer are linked, so this criterion does not apply.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answer mentions a break-even forecast and its specific application to the number of female customers needed to make a profit. The given answer similarly discusses financial information helping to determine necessary revenue and the need for an overdraft, which is a valid linked development.

**Marking Notes:**
- The answer provides linked development and evidence of application by mentioning the need for revenue and the potential requirement for an overdraft, which aligns with the context of Amelia's business plan.

**Total Marks:**
- The answer should be awarded 2 marks as it meets the criteria for linked points and provides a valid explanation with application to the context.

The response mentions that Amelia's unique selling point as a woman can make her happier and help other women relate to her during repairs. This is a valid point but is not well-developed. The candidate also mentions that Amelia wants to deliver good quality customer service, which is an aim and objective, but again, this point is not fully developed or linked to the decision to start the business.

The answer attempts to connect these points but does so in a limited and somewhat disjointed manner. The logical chains of reasoning are not fully established, and the response lacks the detailed interconnected points required for higher levels.

In terms of application (AO2), the response does mention some contextual elements such as Amelia being a woman and her aim to provide good quality service.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states ""quality - the thing she can provide good quality to customers.""
   - **Evaluation:** The term ""quality"" is not one of the traditional elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, Price). The marketing mix elements are specific and well-defined, and ""quality"" is more of a characteristic of the product rather than an element of the marketing mix itself. Therefore, this answer does not fulfill the criteria of stating one element of the marketing mix.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1:** ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham.""
  - This clearly identifies ""Place"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 2:** ""Promotion methods to attract female customers.""
  - This clearly identifies ""Promotion"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 3:** ""Product is to repair/install boilers.""
  - This clearly identifies ""Product"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Marking Notes

- **Application Evidence:** To award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application. The answer should clearly relate to the context of Lili Heating Ltd and identify one of the elements of the marketing mix.

### Conclusion

The answer provided does not meet the criteria of stating one element of the marketing mix. It mentions ""quality,"" which is not one of the four Ps (Product, Place, Promotion, Price) of the marketing mix. Therefore, no marks can be awarded for this answer.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","I choose option 2 - using social media to promote business is free promotions and more people online will be attracted towards it and then buy into the business. Amelia will have more money to grow her business and can also increase revenue, also social media can reach out to more customers that might not be reached through other forms of advertisement. This ensures she's reaching out to as many people as possible and gain more sales from the customers this leads to increase revenue. Offering a discount price to female customers can reach out to more women however she's not attracting everyone like she would if she uses social media to increase revenue. Furthermore only offering discounts to females might cause conflicts and lead to bad reviews, this can decrease sales and revenue.","The candidate begins by stating that they choose Option 2, which is using social media to promote the business. They provide a clear justification for this choice, highlighting the benefits of free promotion and the potential to reach a wider audience. This demonstrates a sound application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts (AO2), placing it in Level 2.

The candidate then discusses the potential increase in revenue and the ability to reach customers who might not be accessible through other forms of advertisement. This shows interconnected points with chains of reasoning, although there are some logical inconsistencies, such as the assumption that social media will automatically lead to increased revenue without considering the quality of the social media strategy. This analysis (AO3a) is also placed in Level 2.

The candidate concludes by comparing the two options, noting that offering discounts to female customers might cause conflicts and lead to bad reviews, which could decrease sales and revenue. This provides a justification based on sound evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b), again placing it in Level 2.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a sound understanding of the business scenario with some inconsistencies, provides interconnected points with some logical chains of reasoning, and makes a justified judgement based on sound evaluation.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",Investing in Ripple is a risk because you don't know how much energy you'll get off the wind farm.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""Investing in Ripple is a risk because you don't know how much energy you'll get off the wind farm.""
   - This statement identifies a specific risk related to the uncertainty of energy supply from the wind farm.
   - The context mentions that ""Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested,"" which implies that the energy supply is variable and dependent on investment, supporting the risk mentioned in the answer.
   - This aligns with the example answer from the mark scheme: ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs (1).""

### Conclusion:
The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple by highlighting the uncertainty in the amount of energy they will receive from the wind farm. This is directly supported by the context and matches the type of risk mentioned in the example answers of the mark scheme.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer identifies a benefit to customers by stating, ""this makes sure they are not spending too much money on what they don't need and are satisfied."" This aligns with the marking criteria as it highlights a financial benefit and customer satisfaction.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer provides linked development by explaining how identifying energy needs ensures customers do not overspend, which is a clear benefit. However, the context of Ripple's specific process is not explicitly mentioned. The answer could be more specific by mentioning Ripple's green energy plan or investment in the wind farm.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

Also paying less tax means they can use this money instead to advertise, this leads to more customers and ripple gets more sales. This increases revenue and makes ripple more successful. Option 2 by providing free training of businesses recruit new employees means ripple will be more likely to get more employees however this won't increase the sales that's why I picked option 1. No extra sales means ripple won't increase revenue and profit and can suffer if they don't have enough customers.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 1 is the best choice for Ripple, providing a clear stance. They justify this by explaining that reduced tax payments would allow Ripple to focus on growth and potentially increase income, which could lead to more job creation and overall success. This demonstrates some application of business concepts to the context of Ripple (AO2). 

The candidate also mentions that paying less tax could allow Ripple to allocate more funds to advertising, which could attract more customers and increase sales, revenue, and success. This shows an attempt to deconstruct business information and find interconnected points, although the reasoning is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth (AO3a).

The candidate briefly considers Option 2, stating that while free training for new employees might attract more staff, it would not directly increase sales, revenue, or profit. This demonstrates some evaluation of the business information, but the justification is limited and not thoroughly developed (AO3b).

Overall, the answer shows a basic understanding of business concepts and makes some connections between points, but the analysis and evaluation are not detailed or logically interconnected. Therefore, this answer should be placed in Level 1.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","Marketing mix is split up to choice, quality, price components. Ripple’s marketing mix offers quality a lower prices compared to its competitors this can mean people want to buy into them compared to competition. This means ripple will lose out on money per customer but will gain more customer so that they can decrease in revenue per customer but increase total revenue. Furthermore by offering a lower price, ripple will be more successful. Ripple customers invest into ripple and save money on energy costs in these homes, it costs the customers alot but in the long run they'll save money and even though it's alot customers are better off investing in ripple becaise its a 'cheaper alternative'. And they ensure ripple makes profit while the customer save money and reduce costs keeping them satisfied and ripple making more money.","The candidate begins by mentioning the components of the marketing mix, but the explanation is somewhat vague and lacks depth. The response then focuses on the price component, stating that Ripple offers lower prices compared to its competitors, which could attract more customers. This is a valid point and shows some understanding of the importance of price in the marketing mix (AO1b).

The candidate attempts to explain the potential trade-off between lower prices and increased customer base, suggesting that while Ripple may lose money per customer, it could increase total revenue by attracting more customers. This demonstrates some interconnected points with chains of reasoning, although the explanation is not fully developed and contains logical inconsistencies (AO3a).

The response also touches on the long-term benefits for customers investing in Ripple, highlighting that they will save money on energy costs in the long run. This shows some application of knowledge to the business context (AO2), but the explanation is somewhat repetitive and lacks clarity.

The conclusion is weak and does not provide a clear justification based on a thorough evaluation of business information and issues (AO3b). The candidate's use of business terminology is limited and not always accurate.

Overall, the response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with limited business terminology used. There is limited application of knowledge to the business context, and the evaluation is based on simple assertions with limited connections between points.

Based on the mark scheme, the response fits best in Level 1. The candidate demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding, with limited application and evaluation.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In my opinion, in Source B and Source C to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War they wouldn't really understand how but if they get told what they were doing and how they was doing it, they would understand it. In Source B you can see lots of aircraft and there is soldiers all in a line and there is lines coming through the air to show where the explosives are going to land and they land a few meters in front of the soldiers and that's because when the explosive goes off it will create smoke and make it hard for the enemys to see so they have time to run and fire and in source C it talks about a soldier getting stuck in his tank and the Germans were gonna going to attack him but then more soldiers came in bigger and better tanks with soldiers behind and destroyed the Germans.","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying some relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student notes the presence of aircraft and soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage, explaining that the explosions create smoke to obscure the enemy's vision. For Source C, the student describes the situation of a tank commander being rescued by newer, faster tanks.

However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include sufficient factual knowledge or extended reasoning. The student does not evaluate the provenance of the sources or explain how these features are useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. The response is more descriptive than evaluative, and there is no attempt to link the sources to broader historical context or to each other.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed evaluation of the content and provenance of both sources, use more specific factual knowledge, and explain how these sources contribute to understanding military technology and tactics during the First World War.

There is the Wall Street crash and that was a big reason for WWI to start because both didn't agree on the same thing and they both had different opinions.  ,"To assess the student's answer according to the Mark Scheme, we need to evaluate the spelling, punctuation, and grammar (SPaG) as well as the use of specialist terms. Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling:
- The student spells all words correctly. There are no spelling errors in the response.

### Punctuation:
- The student uses punctuation marks such as commas and periods. However, the punctuation is not always used correctly. For example:
  - ""I would say that could be one of the main causes but there are also lots of reasons."" This sentence could benefit from a comma after ""causes"" to improve clarity.
  - ""There is the Wall Street crash and that was a big reason for WWI to start because both didn't agree on the same thing and they both had different opinions."" This sentence is a run-on sentence and could be broken down into smaller sentences for better readability.

### Grammar:
- The student uses basic grammar correctly, but there are some issues:
  - ""I would say that could be one of the main causes but there are also lots of reasons."" This sentence is grammatically correct but could be clearer with a comma after ""causes.""
  - ""There is the Wall Street crash and that was a big reason for WWI to start because both didn't agree on the same thing and they both had different opinions."" This sentence is confusing and contains grammatical errors. The Wall Street Crash is not a cause of WWI, and the sentence structure is awkward.

### Use of Specialist Terms:
- The student mentions ""Wall Street crash"" and ""WWI,"" which are relevant terms. However, the Wall Street Crash is historically inaccurate as a cause of WWI. The student does not use a wide range of specialist terms related to the Alliance System or other causes of WWI.

### Analysis:
- **Spelling**: The student spells with consistent accuracy.
- **Punctuation**: The student punctuates with some accuracy but makes errors that affect clarity.
- **Grammar**: The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, but there are errors that hinder the overall clarity.
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses a limited range of specialist terms, and the historical accuracy is questionable.

### Conclusion:
Based on the criteria in the Mark Scheme, the student's answer fits best in **Level 3**:
- The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy.
- The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, but errors do not significantly hinder meaning overall.
- The student uses a limited range of specialist terms as appropriate.

Given that we are a forgiving grader and looking for any excuse to place the student in a higher level, the consistent spelling accuracy and the attempt to use specialist terms, despite the historical inaccuracy, justify awarding the student the maximum mark within Level 3.

#### Identification of a way (1 mark)
- The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""A business would need to use the internet because it can get popular from media."" This is a valid point as it suggests the importance of internet presence for popularity.

#### Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)
- The candidate attempts to explain the way by adding, ""people would only want to go to a place with wifi/internet services."" This explanation is somewhat relevant but lacks clarity and depth. It does not fully develop the initial point about popularity from media or how it affects the choice of location.

### Comparison with Example Answers
- The example answers provide clear and specific reasons, such as choosing a cheaper location due to e-commerce or needing a location with good internet connections for communication. The candidate's answer does not clearly align with these examples in terms of specificity and depth.

### Marking Notes
- The candidate's answer lists one way but does not provide a sufficiently detailed explanation. According to the marking notes, answers that list more than one way with no explanation will be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. In this case, the candidate lists one way but provides an underdeveloped explanation.

     \text{New Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculating the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

The provided answer ""3200000 units"" does not show any correct working steps and is not close to the expected calculations. Therefore, no marks can be awarded for the final answer or the working steps.

  - 3",,If they expand their business where the products they sell are already being portrayed in other shops.,"**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Identification of a way:**
  - The answer identifies a way by stating, ""If they expand their business where the products they sell are already being portrayed in other shops."" This suggests that the small business could become more competitive by expanding its presence in locations where similar products are already available. This identification is somewhat vague but can be considered a valid point. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the way:**
  - The answer does not provide a clear explanation of how expanding their business in such locations would make the small business more competitive. There is no development of the idea or explanation of the benefits or outcomes of this strategy. The answer lacks details on why this would attract more customers or how it would give the business a competitive edge. **(0 marks)**

The answer does not fully satisfy the criteria for explanation as outlined in the mark scheme. The mark scheme expects a clear explanation of the way identified, including how it would benefit the business and make it more competitive. The example answers provided in the mark scheme show a clear cause-and-effect relationship, which is missing in this response.

This would eventually lead to a war as the U.K needs to protect Belgium at all costs as the have a significant alliance between them both this war would cause Germans to loose its shipped/cargoed goods and supplies.,"The student's answer identifies a key issue with the Schlieffen Plan: Germany's invasion of Belgium and the resulting involvement of the United Kingdom due to their alliance with Belgium. This moves the answer beyond level 1, where only general statements and basic knowledge are required. The answer is presented in a structured account, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question, which places it in level 2.

However, the answer lacks depth and detail. It does not provide a developed analysis of causation/consequence or a range of accurate factual knowledge and understanding, which are required for level 3. The explanation of how the invasion of Belgium led to the UK's involvement and the subsequent problems is brief and lacks specific details about the events and their consequences.

To reach level 3, the student would need to provide a more detailed and developed analysis, including specific events, dates, and the broader impact of the Schlieffen Plan's failure. For example, they could explain how the German advance was slowed down by Belgian resistance and British troops, leading to a stalemate and trench warfare on the Western Front.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to provide more specific knowledge and a more sustained line of reasoning. For example, they could explain how the alliance system created a framework for conflict and how specific events, such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, triggered the war within this framework.

Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",Better equipment and more workers,"The answer provided is ""Better equipment and more workers.""

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria and example answers provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success.**
  - The answer does not outline a way financial information could help forecast success. Instead, it mentions ""better equipment and more workers,"" which are potential uses of financial resources but not directly related to how financial information helps forecast success.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks.**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The response does not explain how ""better equipment and more workers"" relate to financial information in a business plan or how they help forecast success.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark.**
  - Since the points are not linked and do not directly address the role of financial information in forecasting success, the response does not meet the criteria for even 1 mark.

### Example Answers:

- **Example Answer 1:** ""The business plan could contain a cash-flow forecast for Lili Heating Ltd (1). This would help ensure there was always enough cash to pay for plumbing supplies (1).""
  - This example clearly outlines how a cash-flow forecast, a piece of financial information, helps ensure sufficient cash flow for supplies, directly linking financial information to business success.

- **Example Answer 2:** ""A break even forecast could be included in the business plan (1). This would set a target of how many female customers were needed to start making a profit (1).""
  - This example outlines how a break-even forecast helps set targets for profitability, again linking financial information to business success.

### Marking Notes:

- **To award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application.**
  - The provided answer lacks linked development and does not show evidence of application to the context of Amelia's business plan.

### Conclusion:

The answer ""Better equipment and more workers"" does not meet the criteria outlined in the mark scheme. It does not explain how financial information in a business plan could help forecast success, nor does it provide linked points or evidence of application.

Italy fled very quickly from the whole war in general just to later switch sides to the Triple Entente. This all caused chaos within Europe which later involved Balkans such as Serbia and Bosnia this is why I strongly think alliances and Europe caused World War one. 
","To assess the student's answer according to the Mark Scheme, we need to evaluate the spelling, punctuation, and grammar (SPaG) as well as the use of specialist terms. Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling:
- ""Entente"" is spelled correctly.
- ""rivalry"" is spelled correctly.
- ""Alliance"" is spelled correctly.
- ""Italy"" is spelled correctly.
- ""chaos"" is spelled correctly.
- ""Balkans"" is spelled correctly.
- ""Serbia"" is spelled correctly.
- ""Bosnia"" is spelled correctly.
- ""World War one"" should be ""World War One"" or ""World War I"" for consistency and accuracy.

### Punctuation:
- The sentence ""I agree as countries in the Triple Entente has fierce rivalry against the countries in the Triple Alliance."" should have a comma after ""agree"" and ""has"" should be ""had"": ""I agree, as countries in the Triple Entente had fierce rivalry against the countries in the Triple Alliance.""
- ""These Alliance system caused more countries to get involved with conflict across Europe and between both alliances."" should be ""This Alliance system caused more countries to get involved in conflicts across Europe and between both alliances.""
- ""Italy fled very quickly from the whole war in general just to later switch sides to the Triple Entente."" is mostly correct but could use a comma for clarity: ""Italy fled very quickly from the whole war in general, just to later switch sides to the Triple Entente.""
- ""This all caused chaos within Europe which later involved Balkans such as Serbia and Bosnia this is why I strongly think alliances and Europe caused World War one."" should be split into two sentences and punctuated correctly: ""This all caused chaos within Europe, which later involved the Balkans, such as Serbia and Bosnia. This is why I strongly think alliances and Europe caused World War One.""

### Grammar:
- ""countries in the Triple Entente has fierce rivalry"" should be ""countries in the Triple Entente had fierce rivalry.""
- ""These Alliance system"" should be ""This Alliance system.""
- ""involved Balkans such as Serbia and Bosnia"" should be ""involved the Balkans, such as Serbia and Bosnia.""
- ""this is why I strongly think alliances and Europe caused World War one"" should be ""This is why I strongly think alliances and Europe caused World War One.""

### Specialist Terms:
- The student uses several specialist terms correctly: ""Triple Entente,"" ""Triple Alliance,"" ""Italy,"" ""Balkans,"" ""Serbia,"" ""Bosnia,"" and ""World War One.""

### Analysis:
- **Spelling**: The student spells most words correctly, with only a minor issue with ""World War one.""
- **Punctuation**: There are several punctuation errors, but they do not severely hinder the meaning.
- **Grammar**: There are some grammatical errors, but the overall meaning is still clear.
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer demonstrates:
- Considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation.
- General control of meaning despite some grammatical errors.
- A good range of specialist terms.

Therefore, the student should be awarded **3 marks** for their answer, placing them in Level 2 (Intermediate performance).",0,3,4,1.0,3.0,False,0.0,0.5625,,,,,8.143561840057373,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 590, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.00295, 'completion_tokens': 693, 'completion_cost': 0.010395, 'total_cost': 0.013345}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 731, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.003655, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.0036699999999999997}"

Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

the doorway is the German Kaiser.","In Source A, the Bolsheviks are portrayed as two-faced as they betrayed Russia for German gold. As we know the Germans and the Russians signed a treaty and gave up land to not fight each other if anything happens since they were weak however, Kaiser Wilhelm II soon broke this treaty and was know to the Russians as a liar and the russians were betrayed. Source A is also critical of the Bolsheviks during the First World war, as there were tensions between Russia and Germany. Germany then formed an alliance with Italy and Austria-Hungary which was known as the Triple Alliance. The same time later Russia joined England and France to form the Triple Entente.","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the portrayal of the Bolsheviks as two-faced and the betrayal of Russia for German gold. They also bring in some factual knowledge about the treaty between Germany and Russia, although the explanation is somewhat unclear and lacks specific details. The mention of the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente is not directly relevant to the Bolsheviks' actions during the First World War and seems to be a digression.

The analysis of the source is simple and lacks the extended reasoning and detailed factual knowledge required for a higher level. The student does not fully explain how the source is critical of the Bolsheviks or provide a clear connection between the source content and the historical context.

Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B and C are both useful to historians studying military tactics in the first world war, since both sources portray an image about the warfare of war. Source B is a picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. Source B shows the reader how the British advanced under a military barrage. Source B shows and portrays to the reader how the British studied what to do under a military barrage. As you can see all the soldiers are running to the right trying to predict where the bullets land. Furthermore, the historian is trying to study tactics in the first world war. In Source B we know the newspaper was a British published piece and in the picture we don't see any injured and dead British soldiers, this is to keep the moral and the urge to fight in their heart as well as the people in the factories making bullets, explosives, etc. In source c, we have an extract from the book Tank Warfare; the story of The Tank in the Great war by Frank Mitchell published after the war. Source c is helpful to the reader historian studying tactics and military technology as Frank Mitchell fought in the war and was a tank commander and describes being in the battle German spring offensive in April 1918. Source C is helpful to a historian studying Military technology as Mitchell was nearly killed in his tank however when he looked on his right he saw '7 of our newest and fastest tanks (whippets), firing machine guns, the drove straight into germans and destroyed the threat' this is helpfull because the historian can replicate and study what happend in the Spring offensive war in April 1918. ","The student demonstrates an understanding of both sources and their relevance to the study of military technology and tactics in the First World War. However, the evaluation of the sources is somewhat basic and lacks depth in terms of contextual knowledge and analysis of provenance.

For Source B, the student identifies that it shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage and mentions that the image was published in a British newspaper in October 1917. The student also notes that the image does not show any injured or dead soldiers, suggesting that this was done to maintain morale. However, the analysis could be further developed by discussing the significance of the date (1917) and the context of the war at that time, such as the Battle of Passchendaele. Additionally, the student could evaluate the provenance more critically by considering the purpose of the newspaper and its potential bias in presenting a positive image of the war.

For Source C, the student identifies that it is an extract from a book by Frank Mitchell, a tank commander, and describes a tank battle during the German Spring Offensive in April 1918. The student highlights the introduction of the ""Whippet"" tanks and their effectiveness in battle. However, the analysis could be enhanced by providing more contextual knowledge about the development and use of tanks in the First World War, as well as the significance of the German Spring Offensive. The student could also evaluate the provenance by considering Mitchell's perspective as a participant in the war and the potential for bias in his account.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 2 due to the simple evaluation of the content and some mention of provenance. To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide more detailed contextual knowledge and extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources. Additionally, a more critical evaluation of the provenance and the relationship between the sources would be necessary to achieve Level 4.

  example_answer: []",,"In 1914, the Germans thought of a plan to capture France then move onto Russia then fight the British, which was known as the Schlieffen plan. The Germans wanted to wipe out the French and move on to Russia thinking the Russian Army would be underprepared however they were preparing for war a long time ago. As the Germans were attacking the French, they managed to get to Verdun which was heavily protected by French, British sent troops to Verdun to release pressure of the French making more time for Russians. This led to a problem for Germany as they were fighting a war on two fronts and Russia joining so their plan failed hugely. ","The student provides a basic overview of the Schlieffen Plan and its intended objectives, which moves the answer beyond level 0. The answer is presented in a structured account, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question, which places it in level 2. The student identifies the key problem of Germany fighting a war on two fronts and mentions the involvement of British troops and the Russian army's preparedness.

However, the analysis remains simple and lacks detailed factual knowledge and understanding. The student does not provide a developed narrative or complex sequencing and reasoning to explain how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to further problems, such as the stalemate on the Western Front or the digging of trenches.

To reach level 3, the student would need to provide a more developed analysis, including specific details about the Battle of the Marne, the impact of the German advance being slowed down, and the resulting stalemate.

However, the explanation lacks depth and detail, and there is no developed reasoning or specific factual knowledge to support the points made. The mention of the Moroccan and Balkan crises is relevant, but again, these points are not elaborated upon.

Also I think the Moroccan and Balkan crises played a part in the build up to war.","To assess the student's answer according to the Mark Scheme, we need to evaluate the spelling, punctuation, and grammar (SPaG) as well as the use of specialist terms. Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling
- The student spells all words correctly. There are no spelling errors in the response.

### Punctuation
- The student uses punctuation, but there are some issues:
  - The sentence ""I agree mostly and disagree, why?"" is awkwardly punctuated. It would be clearer as ""I agree mostly and disagree. Why?""
  - The sentence ""because the Germans sparked tension in Europe since they formed an alliance between Germans, Italy and Austria-Hungary so the British, French and Russians formed an alliance known as the Triple Entente."" is a run-on sentence. It could be improved with better punctuation, such as: ""because the Germans sparked tension in Europe. They formed an alliance with Italy and Austria-Hungary, so the British, French, and Russians formed an alliance known as the Triple Entente.""
  - The final sentence ""Also I think the Moroccan and Balkan crises played a part in the build up to war."" is mostly correct but could use a comma after ""Also"": ""Also, I think the Moroccan and Balkan crises played a part in the build-up to war.""

### Grammar
- The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some areas for improvement:
  - The phrase ""I agree mostly and disagree"" is somewhat confusing. It would be clearer as ""I mostly agree but also disagree.""
  - The use of ""because"" at the beginning of a sentence is informal and could be rephrased for better clarity and formality.

### Use of Specialist Terms
- The student uses several specialist terms appropriately:
  - ""Germans""
  - ""Italy""
  - ""Austria-Hungary""
  - ""British""
  - ""French""
  - ""Russians""
  - ""Triple Entente""
  - ""Moroccan and Balkan crises""

### Analysis
- **Spelling**: The student spells with consistent accuracy.
- **Punctuation**: There are some issues with punctuation, but they do not severely hinder meaning.
- **Grammar**: The student uses grammar with general control of meaning overall, though there are some awkward constructions.
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

### Conclusion
Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's response fits best in **Level 2**. The spelling is consistently accurate, the punctuation is mostly accurate with some minor issues, and the grammar shows general control of meaning. The use of specialist terms is good.

### Final Marks
- **Marks Awarded**: 3 (Level 2, upper range)

The candidate's response is ""one advantage of a starting a business as plc is that you can choose what you want to do with it"". Let's evaluate this answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage**: The candidate states, ""one advantage of a starting a business as plc is that you can choose what you want to do with it"". This statement is vague and does not clearly identify a specific advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The mark scheme provides examples such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. The candidate's response does not align with these examples or provide a clear, specific advantage. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage**: Since the candidate did not clearly identify a specific advantage, there is no explanation provided. The mark scheme expects an explanation that elaborates on the identified advantage, such as how limited liability protects personal possessions or how selling shares can raise finance for the business. The candidate's response lacks this level of detail and explanation. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

Overall, the candidate's response does not meet the requirements of the marking criteria. The answer is too vague and does not provide a clear identification or explanation of an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company.

The candidate has suggested a way through ""the internet can affect where a small business is that it shows amount of people in the area and shows what those people like"". However, the explanation is incomplete and lacks clarity. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating ""the internet can affect where a small business is that it shows amount of people in the area"". This partially identifies a way but is not entirely clear or specific. The identification is somewhat vague and does not directly align with the example answers provided in the mark scheme. Therefore, this point is not fully satisfied.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:
  - The candidate attempts to explain the way by adding ""and shows what those people like (Survey so the business knows what to sell"". This explanation is incomplete and lacks depth. It does not clearly explain how the internet affects the location choice of a small business. The explanation does not align with the example answers, which provide a more detailed rationale, such as using e-commerce to avoid the need for a physical location or needing a location with good internet connections. Therefore, this point is not fully satisfied.

Overall, the candidate's response is not well-developed and lacks clarity. The identification of the way is vague, and the explanation is incomplete. Based on the mark scheme, this answer should be awarded 1 mark for the partial identification of a way.

     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{New break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The decrease is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Decrease} = 4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's evaluate the given answer:

- The provided answer is:
  \[
  4,000 \text{ units} / 6.50 \text{ per unit} = 615 \text{ units}
  \]
  \[
  615 \text{ units}
  \]

- The answer does not use the correct formula for the break-even level of output. Instead, it incorrectly divides the initial break-even level of output by the new selling price.

The candidate's response needs to identify a disadvantage and then explain it further to achieve full marks. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate states, ""A disadvantage is that if they are not paying attention to the customer they will lose interest in the business and leave the job."" This identifies a potential disadvantage, which is employees leaving the job. 
  - **Mark: 1**

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the disadvantage by stating, ""if they are not paying attention to the customer they will lose interest in the business and leave the job."" However, this explanation is somewhat unclear and does not directly link to the issue of not paying employees on time.
  - The candidate further states, ""and work your much customer,"" which is not coherent and does not provide a clear explanation of the disadvantage.
  - The explanation lacks clarity and does not effectively develop the initial point about employees leaving the job due to not being paid on time.
  - **Mark: 0**

### Example Answers Comparison:
- The example answers provide clear and coherent explanations that link the disadvantage to specific outcomes, such as increased recruitment costs or decreased productivity. The candidate's response does not achieve this level of clarity or development.

### Examiner Commentary:
- The candidate has identified a disadvantage, which is employees leaving the job, but the explanation is unclear and does not effectively link to the context of not paying employees on time.
- The response lacks coherence and does not develop the initial point sufficiently to earn further marks.

1. **Identification of an advantage:**
   - The answer does not clearly identify an advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. The statement ""It would start them off as an actually business for the company"" is vague and does not directly address the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as being a cheap source of finance or not paying interest.

2. **Explaining the advantage:**
   - The explanation provided is insufficient and unclear. The phrase ""start them off as an actually business for the company"" does not explain how retained profit benefits the business. It lacks the necessary detail to show understanding of the concept, such as how retained profit avoids interest payments or maintains ownership control.

Let's evaluate this answer against the marking criteria:

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success.**
  - The answer does not mention any specific financial information or how it could help forecast success. It only states that the business is new and people might know about it, which is not related to financial forecasting. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks.**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The statement about the business being new and people knowing about it does not connect to any financial information or forecasting. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark.**
  - Since the points are not linked and the answer does not address financial information or forecasting, it does not meet the criteria for even 1 mark.

#### Marking Criteria: 
- **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**

#### Analysis of the Answer:
- **Answer Provided:** ""Choice.""

#### Evaluation Against Marking Criteria:
1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The marketing mix typically includes the 4 Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion.
   - The answer ""Choice"" does not clearly correspond to any of these elements.
   - The Mark Scheme examples include ""place of distributing her services,"" ""promotion methods,"" and ""product is to repair/install boilers,"" which are clear and specific elements of the marketing mix.
   - The answer does not provide a specific element like ""Product,"" ""Place,"" or ""Promotion,"" nor does it provide any context-specific detail that would link it to Lili Heating Ltd.

#### Conclusion:
- The answer ""Choice"" does not satisfy the criteria of stating one element of the marketing mix.
- There is no evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer does not clearly outline a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. The response states, ""because she is one of few female plumbers in and if she is successful she will the only female plumber in birmingham,"" but it does not link this to a specific reason why the government would be interested in her success. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked to a clear reason why the government would want the business to be successful. The response mentions Amelia being one of the few female plumbers and potentially the only female plumber in Birmingham, but it does not connect this to a government interest such as increased employment, tax revenue, or promoting gender diversity in the workforce. Therefore, this criterion is partially satisfied, and the answer can be awarded 1 mark for mentioning a unique aspect of Amelia's business.

**Example Answers for Reference:**
- ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful (1).""
- ""Taxes will be based on the profits it makes from plumbing repairs (1).""
- ""The government will want more people to be employed (1).""
- ""Amelia may employ more female plumbers if the business is a success (1).""

**Marking Notes:**
- The answer does not provide linked development and evidence of application, which is necessary for awarding 2 marks.
- The response does not clearly connect the unique selling point of Amelia being a female plumber to a reason why the government would want her business to succeed.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer ""financial lost"" does indicate a risk for investors, which is the potential loss of money. This aligns with the example answer ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" provided in the mark scheme.
   - However, the phrasing ""financial lost"" is grammatically incorrect. The correct term should be ""financial loss."" Despite this, the intent of the answer is clear and it does fulfill the criteria of stating a risk.

### Application to Context:
- The context mentions that Ripple is a consumer-owned wind farm where customers invest money to receive energy. The risk of ""financial loss"" is relevant because if the wind farm does not perform as expected or if there are issues in energy production, investors could lose the money they invested.

### Conclusion:
- The answer ""financial lost"" successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, which is the potential loss of money. Despite the grammatical error, the answer is clear and aligns with the example provided in the mark scheme.

### Marks Awarded:
- **1 mark** for correctly identifying a risk for investors in Ripple.

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",,No Answer is provided.

- **Identification of an advantage**: The candidate states, ""Starting a business as a private limited company makes it easier to earn money."" This is not a clear identification of an advantage specific to a private limited company. The mark scheme provides examples such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. The candidate's response does not align with these examples or provide a clear advantage specific to a private limited company. Therefore, this criterion is not met. (0 marks)

- **Explanation of the identified advantage**: The candidate attempts to explain by saying, ""because you're not paying anyone."" This explanation is vague and does not clearly relate to the advantages of a private limited company as outlined in the mark scheme. The mark scheme examples provide detailed explanations such as limited liability protecting personal possessions or raising finance through selling shares. The candidate's explanation does not meet this level of detail or relevance. Therefore, this criterion is not met. (0 marks)

Overall, the candidate's response does not successfully identify or explain an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The response lacks the specificity and clarity required by the mark scheme.

Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:
  - The candidate identifies a way: ""If there's bad WiFi it makes it harder for small business to promote the business."" This is a valid point as it highlights the importance of internet connectivity for business promotion. **1 mark awarded**.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:
  - The candidate does not provide a detailed explanation of how bad WiFi affects the business's ability to promote itself. The answer lacks depth and does not explain the consequences or the process involved. For example, it could have been developed by explaining that poor WiFi can hinder online marketing efforts, social media engagement, or e-commerce activities. **0 marks awarded**.

#### Identification of a way:
- **Criteria:** Identification of a way a small business could become more competitive.
- **Evaluation:** The answer does not clearly identify a specific way a small business could become more competitive. The phrase ""give better chance to there customer"" is vague and does not specify a concrete strategy.
- **Mark Awarded:** 0 marks

#### Explanation of the way:
- **Criteria:** Explanation of the way.
- **Evaluation:** The explanation provided is unclear and lacks coherence. The candidate mentions ""if there selling coco-puffs not alot of people like it People wsnt cocopops the real thing,"" which does not logically explain how giving a ""better chance"" to customers would make the business more competitive.

  - The challenge of setting up a plumbing business in Birmingham, where competition is high, could be a driving force for Amelia (AO2).

  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",,No Answer is provided.

615.3 units","Based on the provided question, answer, and mark scheme, let's evaluate the given answer step-by-step.

### Mark Scheme Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values from the question:
     \[
     \text{New Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output:**
   - Original break-even level of output: 4,000 units
   - New break-even level of output: 2,500 units
   - Decrease in break-even level of output:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

### Given Answer:
- The given answer is:
  \[
  4000/0.50 = 615.3 \quad \text{(incorrect calculation)}
  \]
  \[
  615.3 \text{ units} \quad \text{(incorrect result)}
  \]

### Evaluation:
- The given answer does not use the correct formula for calculating the break-even level of output.
- The calculation \( 4000/0.50 = 615.3 \) is incorrect and does not relate to the problem at hand.
- There is no correct working shown that aligns with the mark scheme.

#### Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark
- The answer identifies a disadvantage: ""that they employees might want to work somwhere else."" This satisfies the first marking criterion.

#### Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks
- The answer attempts to explain the disadvantage by stating, ""this could lead to the business shutting down."" This is a valid point but lacks depth and clarity. It does not fully explain the process or the consequences in detail.
- The answer further states, ""it would affect the owner because he is not paying them on time."" This statement is vague and does not clearly explain how the owner is affected or the specific consequences for the business.

### Comparison with Example Answers
- The example answers provide a clear chain of reasoning, such as employees wanting to leave leading to increased recruitment costs or decreased motivation leading to lower productivity and problems meeting customer orders.
- The given answer lacks this level of detail and logical progression.

- The answer does not clearly identify an advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. The statement ""it would be more easier to calculate to the loan"" is unclear and does not directly identify an advantage. Therefore, this criterion is not met. (0 marks)

**Explaining the advantage:**
- The explanation provided is vague and lacks clarity. The candidate mentions ""this could lead to a better payment system and also have the profit come back in the business,"" but this does not clearly explain an advantage of using retained profit. The explanation does not align with the example answers provided in the mark scheme, such as ""Interest is not paid on retained profit"" or ""Retained profit does not dilute the ownership of the business."" Therefore, this criterion is not met. (0 marks)

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer does not specifically outline a way financial information could help forecast success. Instead, it mentions ""having more research in the market,"" which is not directly related to financial information. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The response does not provide linked points. It only mentions ""having more research in the market"" without further development or linkage to financial information. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - The response does not provide any valid point related to financial information in a business plan. It focuses on market research, which is not the same as financial forecasting. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme specifically mention financial tools such as cash-flow forecasts and break-even forecasts, and how they help in ensuring cash availability or setting profit targets. The given answer does not align with these examples.

**Marking Notes:**
- The marking notes emphasize the need for linked development and evidence of application to award 2 marks. The given answer lacks both.

**Total Marks:**
- The total marks available for this question are 2. However, the provided answer does not meet any of the criteria for awarding marks.

","Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states: ""she should be able to promote her products.""
   - **Evaluation**: The answer mentions ""promote,"" which is one of the elements of the marketing mix (Promotion). This satisfies the criteria of stating an element of the marketing mix.

### Application to Context

- **Evidence of Application**:
  - The mark scheme requires evidence of application to award the mark. The answer should ideally relate the element of the marketing mix to the specific context of Lili Heating Ltd.
  - The answer does not provide any specific application to Lili Heating Ltd. It does not mention how promotion would be used in the context of Amelia's business, such as promoting her unique selling point of being a female plumber or using customer recommendations as a promotional method.

### Example Answers Comparison

- The example answers in the mark scheme provide specific applications:
  - ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham"" (1)
  - ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (1)
  - ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1)
- The given answer lacks this level of specificity and application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Conclusion

- The answer does state an element of the marketing mix (Promotion), but it does not provide evidence of application to the specific context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- According to the marking notes, to award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application.

### Final Mark

- **0 marks**: The answer does not fulfill the requirement of providing evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Summary

- The answer mentions ""promote,"" which is an element of the marketing mix.
- However, it lacks specific application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd, which is necessary to award the mark according to the marking notes.

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

### Marking Criteria:
- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful.**
  - The answer does not provide a clear reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. It mentions ""how she would adapt the products"" and ""how successful she would be,"" but these points are not linked to any specific government interest or benefit. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The response is vague and does not connect the success of Lili Heating Ltd to any specific reason why the government would be interested. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied, and the answer can be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

### Example Answers:
- ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful (1).""
- ""Taxes will be based on the profits it makes from plumbing repairs (1).""
- ""The government will want more people to be employed (1).""
- ""Amelia may employ more female plumbers if the business is a success (1).""

### Marking Notes:
- **Award up to 2 marks for linked points.**
  - The answer does not provide linked points, so it cannot be awarded 2 marks.
- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.**
  - The answer does not provide linked points, so it can be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

### Context:
- The context provided in the question mentions Amelia's unique selling point as a female plumber, her business plan, and her market research. However, the answer does not utilize any of this context to explain why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful.

### Examiner Commentary:
The answer is vague and does not provide a clear reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. It fails to link the success of the business to any specific government interest or benefit. Therefore, the response can only be awarded 1 mark for mentioning success, but it lacks the necessary linkage and context to earn the full 2 marks.

In conclusion i think that she would use social media to promote her products. This means that she would be a successful person.","The candidate's response is quite limited and lacks depth. 

1. **Application of Knowledge and Understanding (AO2):**
   - The candidate mentions that Amelia should choose option 2 because she would adapt her products and promote them using social media. However, this is a very basic application of knowledge and does not demonstrate a sound understanding of the business context. The reference to needing a business plan is vague and not well connected to the context provided.

2. **Deconstruction of Business Information and Issues (AO3a):**
   - The candidate attempts to deconstruct the business information but does so in a very limited manner. The points made are not well interconnected, and there is a lack of logical chains of reasoning. The statement about needing more products to adapt the business is not clearly explained or justified.

3. **Judgement and Justification (AO3b):**
   - The candidate provides a simple judgement that Amelia should use social media to promote her products. However, the justification is minimal and lacks thorough evaluation. The conclusion is repetitive and does not add any new insights or detailed reasoning.

Overall, the response demonstrates limited understanding and analysis. It fits the criteria for Level 1, as it shows limited application of knowledge, attempts basic analysis with limited connections between points, and provides a simple judgement with minimal justification.

Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer provided is ""renewable energy might become a waste.""
   - This statement is somewhat vague and does not clearly articulate a specific risk to investors. The mark scheme examples provide clear and specific risks such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" or ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy.""
   - The answer does not directly state a risk that is easily identifiable or quantifiable for investors. It lacks clarity and specificity.

The mention of ""renewable wave"" and ""solar energy"" is not directly relevant to the options provided in the question. The context of Ripple's business model and its alignment with the UK government's cleaner energy strategy is not effectively utilized. This places AO2 in Level 1.

- **Deconstruction of Business Information (AO3a):** The response attempts to deconstruct business information but fails to find meaningful connections between points. The reasoning is unclear and lacks logical consistency. The candidate mentions tax cuts but does not explain how this would impact Ripple's success. This places AO3a in Level 1.

- **Judgement and Justification (AO3b):** The candidate makes a judgement but provides a very limited and unclear justification. The conclusion is vague and does not offer a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made. This places AO3b in Level 1.

Overall, the response demonstrates a basic understanding of business concepts but fails to make coherent connections or provide a sound evaluation.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","that the importance of marketing mix would be that having a good business plan, this means that it would be able to having better carbon emissions, and also having wind turbines. however it would also include need to better wind station, this mean that it would have not very good solar energy this could lead to not having a very good training staff around team. Also it would need to a successfully business plan This means that it would need to run its solar energy around the area. This could lead to better quality products.In conclusion, I think that having better resourcing would keep the buyers satisfied this means that having a good product","The candidate's response is fragmented and lacks coherence. The answer does not directly address the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. Instead, it discusses various unrelated aspects such as carbon emissions, wind turbines, and solar energy without clear connections to the question.

1. **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b):**
   - The response demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues. The terminology used is vague and not always relevant to the question. 
   - Level 1 criteria are met as there are elements of knowledge and understanding, but they are not well-developed or accurate.

2. **Application (AO2):**
   - There is minimal application of knowledge to the business context. The response does not effectively relate the discussion to Ripple's specific situation or the importance of price in its marketing mix.
   - The application is limited and inconsistent, fitting the Level 1 criteria.

3. **Analysis (AO3a):**
   - The response attempts to deconstruct business information but fails to find meaningful connections between points. The analysis is superficial and lacks depth.
   - This aligns with Level 1 criteria, where there are limited connections between points.

4. **Evaluation (AO3b):**
   - The conclusion is generic and unsupported by a thorough evaluation of business information. The justification provided is simple and lacks depth.
   - This fits the Level 1 criteria, where conclusions are supported by generic assertions from limited evaluation.

Overall, the response is placed in **Level 1** due to its limited application, analysis, and evaluation. The candidate demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding but fails to develop these into a coherent and relevant answer.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""You have limited liability."" This satisfies the first marking criterion and is consistent with the example answer, ""The owners would have limited liability."" Therefore, 1 mark should be awarded for this criterion.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The explanation is provided in the subsequent sentences: ""This means that if your business fails and was to be bankrupt, you would only pay what was invested, the bank will not target your assets if you owe money."" This explanation aligns with the example answer, ""This means that any debts are the responsibility of the business"" and ""Therefore, the personal possessions of the owners will not have to be sold to pay the debts of the business."" Thus, this part of the answer successfully explains the identified advantage and should be awarded 1 mark.
  - The answer further elaborates, ""this means that you have reduced risk of financial failure, which could encourage taking more risks to ensure success.""

### Mark Scheme Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - Break-even formula: Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Variable Costs)
   - Calculation: £10,000 ÷ (£6.50 – £2.50) = 2,500 units
   - Decrease: 4,000 – 2,500 = 1,500 units

2. **Final Answer:**
   - Decrease in break-even level of output: 1,500 units

### Provided Answer Analysis:
1. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - ""3000 x 6.5"" (This step is unclear and seems irrelevant to the problem)
   - ""6.5 x 4000 = 26000"" (This calculates total revenue at the new selling price for 4000 units, but it's not part of the required calculation)
   - ""2.5 x 4000 = 10000 + 10000 = 20000"" (This calculates total variable costs for 4000 units and adds fixed costs, but again, it's not part of the required calculation)
   - ""1600-4000"" (This step is unclear and incorrect)
   - ""6.5 - 5 =11.5 x 4000 = 10000"" (This step is incorrect; the subtraction is wrong and the multiplication is irrelevant)
   - ""1600 units"" (This final answer is incorrect)

2. **Correct Working:**
   - The provided answer does not show the correct substitution into the break-even formula.
   - The final answer of 1600 units is incorrect.

### Grading:
- **Working:**
  - The provided answer does not show any correct working that aligns with the mark scheme.
  - No correct substitution into the formula is shown.

- **Final Answer:**
  - The final answer of 1600 units is incorrect.

","The candidate begins by discussing the benefit of adapting an existing product, stating that it provides a unique selling point and can convince customers to purchase the product over competitors. This is linked to increased sales and market share, which is further connected to reducing the risk of not breaking even. The candidate also mentions that adapting an existing product would cost less, decreasing costs of machinery or labor, which increases the margin of safety and leads to more profit. This profit can be reinvested into the business to stimulate further growth.

However, the candidate also acknowledges potential drawbacks, such as customers perceiving the adapted product as obsolete or too similar to the original, especially for a small business with limited brand awareness. This could lead to fewer sales and a higher risk of failure. Additionally, the candidate notes that the cost to adapt the product may be high if new technology and specialized workers are needed, which would increase costs and the break-even point, reducing the likelihood of making a profit.

","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""The financial side of the plan can assess risks and how to deal with them."" This outlines a way financial information can help forecast success by identifying and managing risks. This satisfies the criteria.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer provides linked development: ""This organisation reduces risk as you can identify funds and don't have to rely on high interest loans and overdrafts, which means the business has sufficient funds to start."" This shows how assessing risks and identifying funds can help avoid high-interest loans and ensure sufficient starting funds, thus linking the points effectively.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - The points are linked, so this criterion does not apply.

- **Example Answers:**
  - The answer does not directly mention specific financial tools like cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis, which are in the example answers. However, it does provide a valid point with linked development about assessing risks and managing funds, which is acceptable as per the marking notes.

- **Marking Notes:**
  - The marking notes state that to award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. The answer provides linked development but lacks specific application to Amelia's business context (e.g., Lili Heating Ltd, female customers, plumbing supplies). 

Given the criteria and the provided answer, the response should be awarded 1 mark for outlining a way financial information can help forecast success and providing linked development, but it lacks specific application to the context of Amelia's business.

  - The internet will not provide focused information to let Amelia know if there will be enough demand for her plumbing and building services (AO2).
  - Although she knows how many females live in Birmingham, it would be difficult to find out how many of them own a property or would want a female plumber to work in their homes (AO3a).
  - Lili Heating Ltd will be in competition against other established plumbers. Amelia will need to spend more time developing her target market to make sure there are enough potential customers (AO3a).

Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Lili's heating used secondary research to find information related to her business. Secondary isn't specific to her business, this means that there could be hidden factors she never took into account as the data was collected for a different purpose. This means the data could be inaccurate for her purpose which can lead to her going into the wrong neighborhood, reducing her sales and revenue. The data is also from 2014 which is wyears before so the data may be different and people age to current data, this could mean she is targeting the wrong audience leading to less sales and brand awareness. However, secondary data is readily accessible and has almost no cost, this means she can analyze the data and quickly apply it to her plans. This means she has more time and investments to tailor to her business to reinvest decreasing risk of failure as she is organized which means her plan seems more attractive to banks to lend money. 
","The candidate begins by identifying that secondary research is not specific to Amelia's business, which is a valid point. This is developed through the idea that there could be hidden factors not accounted for, leading to inaccurate data. The candidate further develops this by suggesting that this could result in targeting the wrong neighborhood, reducing sales and revenue. This chain of reasoning is logical and interconnected, meeting the criteria for AO3a.

The candidate also mentions that the data is from 2014, which may be outdated, leading to targeting the wrong audience and thus less sales and brand awareness. This is another valid point and shows a sound understanding of the limitations of secondary data.

On the positive side, the candidate notes that secondary data is readily accessible and low-cost, allowing Amelia to quickly analyze and apply it to her plans. This is developed through the idea that she can invest more time and resources into her business, reducing the risk of failure and making her business plan more attractive to banks. This shows a detailed understanding of the benefits of secondary data and how it can impact Amelia's business.

In terms of application (AO2), the response is contextualized with references to Amelia, her business (Lili Heating Ltd), and specific details such as the data being from 2014 and the potential for targeting the wrong neighborhood. This demonstrates a detailed application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the business context.

Overall, the response provides detailed, interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning and is heavily contextualized. Therefore, it meets the criteria for Level 3 for both AO2 and AO3a.

","Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**

   - **Evaluation:** The answer states, ""Convenience as she would relate to her target audience: women, showing that they are more comfortable and entitled with her."" 
   - **Analysis:** The term ""convenience"" is not one of the traditional elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, Price). The answer seems to be focusing on the unique selling point (USP) of Amelia being a woman and how it relates to her target audience, but it does not clearly state an element of the marketing mix.
   - **Conclusion:** The answer does not satisfy this criterion as it does not explicitly mention an element of the marketing mix.

### Example Answers

- **Example 1:** ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham (1)""
  - **Comparison:** This example clearly states ""place"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of distributing services to customer homes in Birmingham.
- **Example 2:** ""Promotion methods to attract female customers (1)""
  - **Comparison:** This example clearly states ""promotion"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of attracting female customers.
- **Example 3:** ""Product is to repair/install boilers (1)""
  - **Comparison:** This example clearly states ""product"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of repairing/installing boilers.

### Marking Notes

- **Application Evidence:** To award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application.
  - **Evaluation:** The answer does attempt to apply the concept to the context by mentioning the target audience (women) and how they feel more comfortable with Amelia. However, it fails to clearly identify an element of the marketing mix.

### Conclusion

The answer does not explicitly state an element of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, Price) and therefore does not meet the criteria set out in the mark scheme. The answer focuses on the USP and customer comfort, which are relevant but not directly addressing the question.

","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer states, ""The government would want the business to be successful as they would pay more tax if they are making large sums of profit."" This is a valid point and aligns with the marking criteria that the government will collect more tax if the business is successful. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The answer provides a linked point by explaining that ""the more profit made the higher taxation is on it."" This development links the initial point about paying more tax to the concept of higher profits leading to higher taxes. Thus, the points are linked, and this criterion is satisfied.

- **Example Answers:**
  - The answer closely matches the example answer: ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful (1)."" The candidate's response also includes the development that higher profits lead to higher taxes, which is a valid extension of the example answer.

- **Award any other valid answer. To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer provides a valid reason and links it to the concept of higher profits leading to higher taxes. However, there is no specific evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd, such as mentioning the specific nature of the business (plumbing) or the unique selling point (female plumber).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","If equipment is damaged invester is liable as its their part of land, maintenance will be expensive
","Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""If equipment is damaged invester is liable as its their part of land, maintenance will be expensive."" This statement identifies a specific risk related to the potential damage to equipment and the associated maintenance costs. This is a valid risk for investors in Ripple, as it implies financial liability and potential additional expenses.

### Evidence from the Answer:
- The answer mentions ""If equipment is damaged invester is liable,"" which directly points to a financial risk for the investor.
- It also states, ""maintenance will be expensive,"" further emphasizing the financial burden that could fall on the investor.

### Comparison with Example Answers:
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme include risks such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" and ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy."" While the specific risk mentioned in the answer is different, it still falls under the broader category of financial risks, similar to the example answers.

### Marking Notes:
- The marking notes specify that to award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application. The answer does apply the context of Ripple's business model, as it discusses the potential financial implications for investors who own a part of the wind farm.

The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, fulfilling the criteria set out in the mark scheme. The risk mentioned is specific and relevant to the context of Ripple's business model.

  - 2","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","This offers a variety of choice for the customers to make it personal to their preference meaning they are more likely to be bought as it is the customers choice what to choose increasing revenue
","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""This offers a variety of choice for the customers to make it personal to their preference,"" which implies a benefit to customers. However, it does not clearly articulate a specific benefit such as receiving the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs. The benefit mentioned is somewhat vague and not directly linked to the context of Ripple's services.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer attempts to provide linked development by stating, ""meaning they are more likely to be bought as it is the customers choice what to choose increasing revenue."" However, this development is more focused on the business's revenue rather than the customer's benefit. The context of Ripple's specific service (providing green energy plans based on customer needs) is not clearly applied.

- **Example Answers as a Guide:**
  - The example answers provided in the mark scheme are more specific and directly related to the customer's benefit, such as receiving the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs. The given answer does not align well with these examples.

- **Marking Notes:**
  - According to the marking notes, to award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. The answer lacks clear evidence of application to Ripple's context and does not provide a specific linked benefit to the customer.

**Total Marks Awarded: 1**

    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

Ripple sell also they can reduce prices with this inclining more people to purchase it increasing sales leading to more revenue and less risk of failure. But will end once successful leading to a sudden drop in profit redicing level of success nad consilla. However option 2 means less money and time of the business is spent on employees this means that there is less fixed costs in the business meaning there is a much higher margin of safety if the business breaks even this reduces risk and can increase financial success. However this also means the business has to recruit new employees meaning that they have to spend more time finding suitable employes and pay their salary while training so the workers are not affecting the business until training is over this can reduce output as more employees havent started yet and reduces time for the owner leading to less sales and more stress for the owner as he has more to deal with increasing risk of failure. Overall option one offers less flaws and large benefits to a small business but once successful will no longer be in use wheras 2 will be useful as long as the business operates
","The candidate begins by discussing the impact of reduced tax on Ripple, noting that it would allow for more retained profits which could be reinvested to reduce costs and increase efficiency. This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2) and attempts to connect points logically (AO3a). However, the explanation is somewhat fragmented and lacks depth. The candidate then considers the potential drawbacks of this option, mentioning a sudden drop in profit once the tax reduction ends, which shows some evaluation (AO3b).

In the second part, the candidate discusses the impact of government-funded training, noting that it would reduce fixed costs and increase the margin of safety. This again shows some application of business concepts (AO2) and attempts to connect points logically (AO3a). The candidate also considers the drawbacks, such as the time and cost of recruiting and training new employees, which shows some evaluation (AO3b).

The conclusion states that option one offers fewer flaws and larger benefits, but the reasoning is not fully developed and lacks clarity. Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of business concepts and makes some connections between points, but the analysis and evaluation are limited and not fully developed.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","Ripple has a unique selling point on sustainability as it doesn't harm the environment while also supplying energy to the investor this offers convenience as they can gain revenue and energy for themselves, this means if the investor has shares the costs are reduced for them offering convenience, this would incline them to buy more plots of land. It also crosses price as the investor may see some return on investment from excess energy or extra value from supplying them this means that although prices may be expensive this may not be an issue as investors may still purchase it increasing security and decreasing risk. They also claim that its cheaper than investors this gives them the upper hand over other businesses who may charge more this means they may not earn as much but have investors generating income for them regularly reducing risk of failure. However, Ripple sell you the land with the generators which still cost a lot this would put of many as the price may not serve value to the customers who may not have a business this can decrease chance of survival and may make the service obsolete as it may only benefit large businesses reducing sales. They also require maintenance and depend on weather this presents a lot of risk and extra payments that the consumer are finding will not want to purchase the service as it cause issues for them, this reduces sales and potential loyal customers. Overall Apple doesn't really focus on price as it sees success in large investors who see profit in it and people who care about sustainability, they can also sell energy generated that they own which eliminates risk and necessity to reduce and focus on price as much as others like a USP of convenience to customers.
","The candidate begins by discussing Ripple's unique selling point (USP) of sustainability and its convenience for investors, which is relevant to the question. They mention that investors can gain revenue and energy, which touches on the importance of price indirectly. However, the explanation is somewhat vague and lacks depth.

In the second paragraph, the candidate discusses the potential return on investment and the claim that Ripple's energy is cheaper than competitors. This is a relevant point about price, but the explanation is not fully developed. The candidate mentions that this could reduce risk and increase security, but does not provide detailed reasoning or examples.

The third paragraph introduces a counterpoint about the high cost of land and generators, which could deter customers. This is a valid consideration but is not fully explored. The candidate also mentions maintenance and weather dependency, which are relevant points but are not linked back to the importance of price in the marketing mix.

The conclusion attempts to summarize the points made but is somewhat unclear. The candidate states that Ripple does not focus on price as much as other factors like sustainability and convenience, but this is not well-supported by the preceding analysis.

Overall, the response demonstrates some understanding of the business concepts and issues (AO1b) and applies them to the context of Ripple (AO2). However, the analysis lacks depth and logical consistency (AO3a), and the evaluation is limited (AO3b).

Based on the mark scheme, this response fits into Level 2. The candidate demonstrates mostly accurate knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with some application to the business context.

      Source C is useful because the author is an experienced soldier. His account gives an accurate picture of the threat posed by Germany’s successful advance in the Spring Offensive using storm troopers. The new design of British tank was one of the ways in which this threat was countered.'

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```",Source B and C can be useful to a historian. For example source B shows us that the tactics of the british advance under an artillery barrage was very effective. I know this because you can see them advancing efficiently and with little casualtys. In source C it shows us that Britain was rapidly advancing and was prepared to fight this war. This is useful for a historian because it shows how britain advanced in WW1.,"The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student notes that the British advance under an artillery barrage appears effective, as evidenced by the soldiers advancing efficiently with few casualties. For Source C, the student highlights the rapid advancement and preparedness of British forces, as demonstrated by the use of the new 'Whippet' tanks.

However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include extended reasoning or detailed factual knowledge. The student does not evaluate the provenance of the sources or provide a complex evaluation of their utility. To reach a higher level, the student would need to incorporate more specific contextual knowledge, evaluate the provenance of the sources, and provide a more detailed analysis of how these sources are useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

The student mentions the Schlieffen Plan but does not explain it or its relevance to the question. The explanation of the Alliance System is also very basic, stating that it made other countries feel threatened without providing specific details or examples.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide a more detailed explanation of the Alliance System, including the specific alliances formed (e.g., Triple Alliance and Triple Entente) and how these alliances contributed to the escalation of tensions leading to the war.

#### Spelling and Punctuation
- **Spelling**: The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
  - ""chliffien"" should be ""Schlieffen""
  - ""country's"" should be ""countries""
- **Punctuation**: The student uses punctuation reasonably well but there are some issues:
  - Missing comma after ""For instance""
  - Missing comma after ""for example""
  - The sentence ""For instance there was many more reasons why WWI started for example the chliffien plan."" is a run-on sentence and could be better punctuated.

#### Grammar
- **Grammar**: The student demonstrates a general control of grammar, but there are some errors:
  - ""there was many more reasons"" should be ""there were many more reasons""
  - ""a lot of more other country's"" should be ""a lot more other countries""
  - ""before Britain gets too big"" should be ""before Britain got too big"" for consistency in tense.

#### Use of Specialist Terms
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses some specialist terms, such as ""Alliance System"" and ""Schlieffen Plan"" (albeit misspelled), but the range is limited.

### Level Assessment
- **Level 1 Criteria**: The student does not meet the criteria for Level 1 as there are several spelling and grammatical errors, and the range of specialist terms is not wide.
- **Level 2 Criteria**: The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, but not consistent accuracy. The control of grammar is general but not effective overall. The range of specialist terms is good but not extensive.
- **Level 3 Criteria**: The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy. The control of grammar is sufficient to convey meaning, though there are errors. The range of specialist terms is limited but present.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student’s performance aligns most closely with Level 2, but at the lower end of this level due to the noted errors.

### Final Marks Awarded

  - The candidate identifies an advantage by stating, ""One advantage of starting a business as a private limited company is that they won't have their ideas copied by other businesses."" This is not a typical advantage of a private limited company as per the mark scheme, which focuses on limited liability and the ability to raise finance through selling shares.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the identified advantage by stating, ""I know this because when a business is private other companies won't be able to use their ideas and products for their own business.""

The candidate's response should be evaluated against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate does not clearly identify a way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate. Instead, they discuss the presence of bigger businesses affecting customer choices, which is not directly related to the internet's impact on location choice. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate explains that the presence of bigger businesses could affect customer choices, but this explanation is not linked to the internet's impact on location. The explanation provided is more about competition rather than the influence of the internet. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

**Example Answers for Reference:**
- ""The business could choose a cheaper location (1)""
- ""This is because the business can use e-commerce (1)""
- ""As a result, the business may not require a physical retail location (1)""
- ""The business will need to be in a location with good internet connections (1)""
- ""This is because a business may need the internet to communicate with stakeholders (1)""
- ""A location with a weak signal could cause barriers to communication for the business (1)""

**Marking Notes:**
- The candidate's response does not align with the example answers provided in the mark scheme.
- The response does not identify a way the internet affects location choice, nor does it provide an explanation related to the internet.

Answer: 1,500 units (1)",,"4000/5=800
800 units","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's evaluate the given Answer step by step.

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values from the question:
     \[
     \text{New Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's review the given Answer:
- The given Answer is: 
  \[
  4000/5=800 \quad \text{(800 units)}
  \]

**Evaluation:**
- The given Answer does not use the correct formula for calculating the break-even level of output.
- The calculation \( 4000/5=800 \) is incorrect and does not relate to the problem at hand.
- There is no correct working shown that aligns with the Mark Scheme.

  - The points are somewhat linked. The answer connects the need for an overdraft with forecasting potential success. However, the linkage could be clearer and more detailed. For example, it could explain how knowing the need for an overdraft helps in planning and ensuring liquidity.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - The points are linked but not strongly. The answer does not fully develop the idea of how financial information helps forecast success beyond mentioning the overdraft.

- **Example Answers:**
  - The example answers provide more detailed linkage and context. For instance, mentioning a cash-flow forecast ensuring enough cash for supplies or a break-even forecast setting a target for customers. The given answer lacks this level of detail and specific application to Lili Heating Ltd.

- **Marking Notes:**
  - To award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. The answer does not fully meet this criterion as it lacks detailed development and specific application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

  - The challenge of setting up a plumbing business in Birmingham, where competition is high, could be a driving force for Amelia (AO2).
  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).
  - As a result, she would be determined to succeed as there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. This could give her an extra incentive to do well. (AO3a).
  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families.

Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","The impact of non-financial aims on Amelia's decision to start her own business called Lili Heating Ltd is that she could get personal satisfaction if people share her new business around to other people. It can make her have a successful business and get more customers. However, this can also have a negative impact on her new business because people might not like the work she has been putting in and might tell other people how bad her company is. The customers would also tell others to not ask her company for help.","The candidate's response identifies a non-financial aim, ""personal satisfaction,"" and links it to the potential success of Amelia's business through word-of-mouth recommendations. This is a valid point and aligns with the indicative content that suggests non-financial aims can drive business success. However, the response lacks depth and detailed application of business concepts and issues to the context of Amelia's situation.

The candidate briefly mentions a potential negative impact, but this point is not well-developed or linked to the context of Amelia's business. The response does not provide interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning, which is necessary for higher-level marks.

**Level Determination:**
- **AO2 (Application):** The response shows limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context of Amelia's business. The mention of ""personal satisfaction"" and word-of-mouth recommendations is relevant but not deeply explored.
- **AO3a (Analysis):** The response attempts to deconstruct the issue but finds limited connections between points. The analysis is superficial and lacks detailed reasoning.

**Level Assignment:**
- The response fits the criteria for **Level 1** due to its limited application and superficial analysis.

**Mark Assignment:**
- Given the limited depth and development, the response is awarded **2 marks** within Level 1.

### Marking Criteria:
1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The Answer states: ""One element of the marketing mix could be place and where she is located at.""
   - This statement identifies ""place"" as an element of the marketing mix, which is correct according to the Mark Scheme. The example answer in the Mark Scheme mentions ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham,"" which aligns with the concept of ""place"" in the marketing mix.
   - However, the Answer lacks specific application to Lili Heating Ltd. The context mentions that Amelia plans to operate in the Birmingham area, but the Answer does not explicitly connect ""place"" to this context. To fully satisfy the criteria, the Answer should have included a specific reference to distributing services in Birmingham or a similar detail.

### Conclusion:
- The Answer correctly identifies ""place"" as an element of the marketing mix, which aligns with the Mark Scheme.
- However, it lacks specific application to Lili Heating Ltd, as required by the marking notes.

### Marks Awarded:
- Based on the Mark Scheme, 1 mark can be awarded for correctly identifying an element of the marketing mix.
- Since the Answer does not fully apply this element to Lili Heating Ltd, it does not meet the full criteria for application.

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","I think she should choose option 2 because if she promotes her business on social media people might see her advertisement and share it around to other people. It also means she doesn’t have to give any discount price out to her female customers so she can possibly get more money. 
However, there could be a possibility that option 1 makes her business more successful than option 2 because people might not like to try anything new as it could cause problems. Therefore, people might not go and ask her for Lili even if they see her advertisement and promotion on social media.","The candidate begins by stating that Amelia should choose option 2, which is promoting her business on social media. They provide some reasoning for this choice, mentioning that social media can help spread the word about her business and that she wouldn't need to offer discounts, potentially increasing her revenue. This demonstrates some application of business concepts to the context (AO2), but it is not detailed.

The candidate then considers the potential downside of option 2, suggesting that people might be hesitant to try a new service even if they see it advertised on social media. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but the reasoning is somewhat limited and lacks depth.

Overall, the answer shows limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2). The analysis (AO3a) is basic, with limited connections between points. The judgement (AO3b) is simple and based on limited evaluation.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",An example of a risk for an investor is that they could pay money to Ripple and not get anything or not get the amount they need.,"Let's evaluate the given Answer against the Mark Scheme criteria.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The Answer states, ""An example of a risk for an investor is that they could pay money to Ripple and not get anything or not get the amount they need.""
   - This statement identifies a potential risk for investors, which is the possibility of not receiving the expected return on their investment or not getting the amount of energy they need.
   - This aligns with the example answer from the Mark Scheme: ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs (1).""
   - Therefore, the Answer successfully fulfills this criterion.

### Conclusion:
The Answer meets the criteria set out in the Mark Scheme by clearly stating a risk for investors in Ripple, which is the possibility of not receiving the expected amount of energy. This is supported by the context that Ripple supplies energy based on the amount of money invested, and there is a risk that the supply may not meet the investor's needs.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""their business could supply the customers with how much energy they need because they will know by asking them questions."" This indicates a benefit to customers as it implies that Ripple will be able to tailor the energy supply to meet the specific needs of each customer. This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying a benefit to customers.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The response does not provide linked development or specific evidence of application. It mentions that Ripple will know the customers' needs by asking questions, but it does not develop this point further or provide specific context from the provided information. For example, it could have mentioned how this tailored approach ensures customers receive the correct amount of energy for their needs or how it could lead to cost savings.

- **Example Answers Comparison:**
  - The example answers in the mark scheme provide a clear benefit followed by a linked development. For instance, ""Customers will receive the correct green energy plan (1). This will make sure they receive the correct amount of energy for their needs (1)."" The given answer lacks this level of detail and linkage.

- **Marking Notes:**
  - According to the marking notes, to award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. Since the response does not fully develop the point or provide specific context, it does not meet the criteria for 2 marks.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

This infers that whoever made this cartoon believes that the Bolsheviks are just taking and taking from Russia. Also in the cartoon, we can see a man who depicts Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany stood behind a curtain and rubbing his fists together.

The student also identifies the figure of Kaiser Wilhelm II and explains his presence as indicating that the Bolsheviks were working for Germany. This analysis shows understanding of the source's content and its critical stance towards the Bolsheviks.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Sources B and C are helpful to historians studying military technology and tactics. For example, in Source B it shows us how the British army planned to use an artillery barrage (or more commonly known as a 'creeping barrage') in battles. This source is helpful because it shows historians how Britain planned to end the stalemate and push the German troops back, even further. Source B also helps the reader see the progress in terms of how military tactics improved. Source B is quite helpful because it shows historians how the 'creeping barrages' were supposed to work, we know that this wasn't the case and the first few times it was used, it ended up with many British troops being killed by their own. 

Source C is helpful to historians because it gives them a first hand account of what it was like being in a tank during a battle. This source is also very credible because it was written by a soldier, who was in the battle and recieved a medal for bravery in that battle.

Source C is helpful to historians because it gives them an idea of how the soldiers felt during battle and how greatful they were about the newest tanks, 'whippets', coming and helping them from being attacked by the germans. ","The student demonstrates an understanding of both sources and provides some analysis of their content. For Source B, the student explains the concept of the 'creeping barrage' and its intended purpose in breaking the stalemate on the Western Front. They also mention the initial failures of this tactic, which adds some contextual knowledge. However, the evaluation of the provenance is limited, and the explanation of how this source is useful to historians could be more developed.

For Source C, the student identifies that it is a first-hand account from a tank commander, which adds credibility. They also describe the effectiveness of the new 'Whippet' tanks in battle. However, the evaluation of the provenance is again limited, and the explanation of how this source is useful to historians could be more detailed.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed factual knowledge and a more thorough evaluation of the provenance of both sources. They should also make more explicit connections between the content and provenance of the sources and their utility to historians.

Britain and France pushed Germany back to the Hindenburg Line and then many German soldiers went to go and invade Russia, however, Germany weren't prepared for how quick Russia re-armed.

Consequently, meaning that Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and due to their alliance so did germany, but when germany declared war russia backed up serbia and declared war on germany and Austria-Hungary. Then Germany and Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia and then france backed up Russia and declared war on germany. So germany declared war on france and went to invade them, but instead on invading france directly they went into Belgium who had an alliance with britain.

","The student provides a basic explanation of the stated factor, the Alliance System, and how it led to the escalation of the conflict. They mention the alliances between Germany and Austria-Hungary, and how these alliances pulled other countries into the conflict, leading to World War I. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge. The student also briefly mentions the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, but this is not developed into a full explanation.

The answer demonstrates a basic line of reasoning and some coherence, but it lacks the detailed knowledge and complex explanation required for higher levels. The conclusion is very brief and does not add much to the argument.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors such as ""germany"" instead of ""Germany,"" ""france"" instead of ""France,"" and ""britain"" instead of ""Britain."" These errors are consistent throughout the answer.
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some issues with comma usage and run-on sentences. For example, ""Consequently, meaning that Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and due to their alliance so did germany, but when germany declared war russia backed up serbia and declared war on germany and Austria-Hungary."" This sentence could be broken down for better clarity.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall. The meaning of the answer is clear, but there are some grammatical errors that slightly hinder the flow of the text. For example, ""This furthermore led to Austria-Hungary entering Bosnia, which Serbia didn’t like so tried to get Russia involved."" This sentence could be rephrased for better clarity.
   - The use of conjunctions and transitions could be improved to enhance the overall coherence of the answer.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""alliance,"" ""Balkan crisis,"" ""archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Black Hand,"" and ""Serbian military."" These terms are appropriate and relevant to the topic.

**Conclusion:**
- The student demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, though there are some recurring errors.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","The British soldiers advanced under a artillery barrage in the summer of 1917. This image demonstrates the tactics used during WW1, where artillery bombardments were often used to soften enemy defenses before infantry advances. The artillery barrage was a crucial component of French warfare during this period, but this could also be propaganda to showcase British military strength and resilience during WW1. The soldiers were depicted as brave and determined despite facing heavy enemy fire.  ","The student identifies relevant features of Source B, such as the use of artillery bombardments and infantry advances, and explains their significance in the context of WW1 tactics. However, the analysis is somewhat basic and lacks depth. The mention of propaganda is a good point but is not fully developed or linked back to the source's utility for a historian. There is no mention of Source C, which is required to fully address the question.

To improve, the student should include more detailed evaluation of Source B, considering both content and provenance, and then provide a similar analysis for Source C. Additionally, they should link their points back to the question of how useful the sources are for a historian studying military technology and tactics in WW1.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen Plan was a military strategy developed by the German Empire before WWI. It aimed to quickly defeat France in the west and then focus on Russia in the east. However, the plan had several weaknesses that led to problems in 1914. One key issue was the violation of Belgian neutrality. Germany's invasion of Belgium to execute the Schlieffen Plan brought the UK into the war. As they were committed to protecting Belgian neutrality. This decision significantly expanded the conflict beyond what Germany anticipated. additionally, the Schlieffen Plan relied heavily on precise timing and movement of troops. any delays or miscalculations in the execution of the plan could mess up the plan. This became evident during the Battle of the Marne when German advance had halted, forcing them to retreat. The failure to achieve a quick victory in France undermined the core principle of the Schlieffen Plan, leading to a prolonged and costly war on the Western front furthermore, the plan underestimated the resilience and determination of the allied forces. the french and british armies put up a strong defence slowing down the German advances. The inability to swiftly defeat France g impeded by the Schlieffen plan's failure to deliver a swift victory in France. the violation of Belgium, and the resiliency of the the allied forces all contributed to the problems faced in 1916. these factors ultimately led to a protracted and devastating conflict that diverged significantly from the initial expectations of the german military command.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer identifies key issues such as the violation of Belgian neutrality, which brought the UK into the war, and the reliance on precise timing and movement of troops, which led to problems during the Battle of the Marne. The student also mentions the resilience of the Allied forces, which slowed down the German advance.

The answer moves beyond Level 1 by identifying relevant events and providing a structured account, placing it in Level 2. The student shows a simple analysis of causation/consequence by explaining how the failure to achieve a quick victory in France led to a prolonged and costly war on the Western Front.

To reach Level 3, the answer would need to demonstrate a developed analysis of causation/consequence with more detailed sequencing and reasoning.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's analyze the student's answer step-by-step to determine the appropriate level and marks to be awarded.

### Spelling
- The student spells all words correctly, including more complex terms like ""significant,"" ""contributing,"" ""escalate,"" ""obligations,"" ""militarism,"" ""nationalism,"" ""imperialism,"" and ""assassination.""
- Proper nouns such as ""WWI,"" ""archduke franz ferdinand,"" and ""first world war"" are spelled correctly, though they lack capitalization.

### Punctuation
- The student uses commas and periods correctly in most places.
- However, there are some punctuation issues:
  - The sentence starting with ""however"" should be capitalized.
  - The phrase ""archduke franz ferdinand"" should be capitalized as ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand.""
  - The sentence ""therefore, while the alliance system was a key element, it was the combination of various factors that ultimately led to the first world war."" should start with a capital ""T"" for ""Therefore.""

### Grammar
- The student generally uses grammar correctly, with effective control of meaning overall.
- The use of conjunctions and transitions like ""however,"" ""therefore,"" and ""while"" shows a good grasp of complex sentence structures.
- There are minor grammatical issues, such as the lack of capitalization at the beginning of some sentences and proper nouns.

### Use of Specialist Terms
- The student uses a wide range of specialist terms appropriately, including ""alliance system,"" ""militarism,"" ""nationalism,"" ""imperialism,"" and ""assassination of archduke franz ferdinand.""

### Analysis
- **Spelling**: Consistent accuracy.
- **Punctuation**: Considerable accuracy, but not consistent due to capitalization errors.
- **Grammar**: Effective control of meaning overall, with minor issues.
- **Specialist Terms**: Wide range used appropriately.

### Conclusion
Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer demonstrates:
- Consistent accuracy in spelling.
- Considerable accuracy in punctuation, with minor errors.
- Effective control of grammar with minor issues.
- A wide range of specialist terms used appropriately.

While the punctuation errors prevent it from being a perfect Level 1, the overall control of meaning and the use of specialist terms suggest a high performance. Given the forgiving nature of the grading, we can place this answer at the higher end of Level 2, awarding it the maximum marks for that level.

For example, they could explain that the Bolshevik Revolution led to Russia withdrawing from World War I and making peace with Germany, which allowed Germany to focus its forces on the Western Front.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B it shows how artillery was used for cover and creeping barrage. Initially the creeping barrage was not used very well in battles, such as the Somme. It wasnt used well because people didn't know how to fire shells accurately and they would blow up their own soldiers. Source B shows how much more accurate people got firing the artillery shells and by the first world war artillery was being used much more effectively.
Source C tells about how tanks were used in the first world war. Originally tanks weren't used properly or effectively. Tanks were sent out in ones and would be picked off easily by the Germans. Eventually the allies would be sending 100-200 tanks at a time which was much more effective than just the 1.","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some basic analysis. For Source B, they mention the use of artillery and creeping barrage, and for Source C, they discuss the use of tanks. However, the analysis is quite simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not provide much factual knowledge or detailed context to support their points. 

For Source B, the student mentions the initial inaccuracy of artillery during battles like the Somme but does not elaborate on how this improved over time or provide specific examples. For Source C, the student notes the initial ineffective use of tanks and the eventual deployment of larger numbers but does not provide specific details or examples of battles where this tactic was used effectively.

The evaluation of the provenance of the sources is also lacking. The student does not discuss the significance of Source B being published in a British newspaper in 1917 or the impact of Source C being written by a tank commander after the war.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed factual knowledge, evaluate the provenance of the sources, and offer more developed analysis and reasoning related to the utility of the sources.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```",Source B is an image of soldiers using one of their most commonly used tactic. The way they used this tactic was using cannons for soldiers to jump into then they send another over the top and repeatedly done this until they got to German trenches and went diving in with their bayonets. Source C is about a story of an army soldier who drove a tank in world war and tells us about his story. Him and his tank was stuck and Germans were ready to attack although 7 of the newest army tanks came streaming through spraying their machine guns quickly making Germans vanish because the tank is a metal box of horror. ,"The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student describes the tactic of using artillery to support infantry advances, though the explanation is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. For Source C, the student summarizes the account of a tank commander, highlighting the effectiveness of the new 'Whippet' tanks in combat.

However, the response lacks detailed evaluation and contextual knowledge. There is no discussion of the provenance of the sources or how this affects their utility. The student does not provide any extended reasoning or complex evaluation, which is necessary for higher levels.

To improve, the student should include more specific factual knowledge about the First World War, such as the development of military technology and tactics over time. They should also evaluate the reliability and usefulness of the sources based on their origin, purpose, and content.

Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

### Spelling:
- ""alot"" should be ""a lot""
- ""of"" should be ""have"" in ""would of been""
- ""Britain and Germany was"" should be ""Britain and Germany were""

### Punctuation:
- The sentence ""With this question I agree but also don’t agree because if Britain and Germany was to just have their battle maybe it would of been over faster but alot of alliances kept the war going for a long period of time."" is a run-on sentence and needs better punctuation for clarity.
- A comma is needed after ""With this question I agree but also don’t agree"" to separate the clauses.
- A comma is needed after ""battle"" to separate the clauses.
- A period or semicolon is needed before ""but a lot of alliances kept the war going for a long period of time.""

### Grammar:
- ""Britain and Germany was"" should be ""Britain and Germany were"" to maintain subject-verb agreement.
- ""would of been"" should be ""would have been"" for correct verb form.
- The sentence structure is somewhat awkward and could be improved for clarity.

### Specialist Terms:
- The student does not use a wide range of specialist terms. The terms ""Britain,"" ""Germany,"" and ""alliances"" are relevant but not particularly specialized.

### Evaluation:
- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy but makes several errors.
- **Grammar:** The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, but errors are present. These errors do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student uses a limited range of specialist terms.

### Conclusion:
Based on the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- **Level 1:** The student does not meet the criteria for consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation, nor do they use a wide range of specialist terms.
- **Level 2:** The student does not meet the criteria for considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, nor do they use a good range of specialist terms.
- **Level 3:** The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, and uses a limited range of specialist terms.

Given the forgiving nature of the grading and the overall performance, the student’s answer fits best within **Level 3**.

Context:
Source A:  A British cartoon entitled ‘Betrayed’, published in December 1917. The figure in
the doorway is the German Kaiser.

Answer:
The cartoon shows a Bolshevik dragging Russia towards Germany, which is represented by the German Kaiser in the doorway. This is critical of the Bolsheviks because it suggests that they are betraying Russia by making peace with Germany. The title 'Betrayed' reinforces this idea. The cartoon was published in December 1917, shortly after the Bolshevik Revolution, when Lenin took power and began negotiating peace with Germany. This peace, known as the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was signed in March 1918 and allowed Germany to focus its military efforts on the Western Front, which was detrimental to the Allies.

Response:
The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the Bolshevik dragging Russia towards Germany and the German Kaiser in the doorway. They explain how these features are critical of the Bolsheviks, suggesting betrayal. The student also provides contextual knowledge about the Bolshevik Revolution, Lenin's negotiations for peace, and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows Britians new tatric called shelling time table. This was used to attrack the enemys and take land. This also helped to stop stalement and create movement from the other side. How this plan would work is for example a cannon shot every 4 minutes going 30 yards forward everytime. The soldiers would then go right behind where the shell is going to explode and the attack opponents that are still alive and also attack the trenches. Source C shows Britians new development in tanks. The British would take 30-40 tanks to battle. Although tanks were extremily expensive they was very useful becouse of the fact they had a turrent which is a gun inside the tank that can easily rotate 360°. Tanks could also fire shells and were hard to destroy. Although Tanks were good at fighting against the opposition enemys they wasnt very fast only be able to go around 34 mites per hour which is a basic walking pace. Tanks become used more by the British and they was continuely being developed becoming quicker and stronger. 
","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some basic analysis. For Source B, they describe the tactic of the creeping barrage and explain how it was used to advance on enemy positions. For Source C, they describe the development and use of tanks, specifically the 'Whippets,' and their effectiveness in battle. However, the analysis lacks depth and detailed contextual knowledge.

The student does not provide a developed evaluation of the provenance of either source. They do not discuss the significance of Source B being a picture published in a British newspaper in 1917 or the fact that Source C is an account from a tank commander published after the war. This limits the answer to a simple evaluation based on content.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to include more detailed factual knowledge and provide a more developed evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources. They should also consider the relationship between the sources and how they together provide a more comprehensive understanding of military technology and tactics in the First World War.

This plan soon came to an end after first invading Belgium but Britain had an alliance with Belgium where if anyone tried to invade them then Britain will start to fight against them. This created tension between Belgium and Germany. Germans then went into France attempting to invade Paris. Germans was around 40 miles away from Paris in the river Marne where a battle was started. The Battle of the Marne was the dangerous battle with the most deaths and most injuries coming out off the Battle of Marne.","The student provides a basic narrative of the Schlieffen Plan and its initial execution, identifying key events such as the invasion of Belgium and the subsequent involvement of Britain due to their alliance with Belgium. This moves the answer beyond level 1, where only general statements and basic knowledge are required. The answer is presented in a structured account, with events in chronological order, leading to a simple analysis of causation/consequence, placing it in level 2.

However, the answer lacks the depth and range of accurate knowledge and understanding required for higher levels. The student does not provide detailed factual knowledge or a developed analysis of how these events led to problems in 1914. For example, there is no mention of the impact of the German advance being slowed down, the need to send troops east due to Russia's quicker-than-expected mobilization, or the resulting stalemate and trench warfare on the Western Front.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors such as ""Britian"" instead of ""Britain"" and ""creae"" instead of ""create.""
   - Punctuation is generally used correctly, but there are some issues with missing commas and periods, which slightly affect the readability of the text. For example, ""In the Balkans Austria-Hungary arch duke Franz Ferdinand was murdered by Serbian terrorist group 'the black hand'"" should have a comma after ""Balkans"" and ""Austria-Hungary.""

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall. The meaning of the text is clear, but there are some grammatical errors that slightly hinder the flow. For example, ""which because of triple alliance then allowed Germany to be involved"" is awkwardly phrased and could be clearer.
   - There are some run-on sentences and fragments, such as ""France then joined the war in the balkans. but because of France's alliances with Britian and Russia (called the triple entente) this also meant that Britian and Russia had to join the war."" The period after ""Balkans"" should be a comma, and ""but"" should not start a new sentence.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""triple alliance,"" ""arch duke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""the black hand,"" ""Moroccan crisis,"" ""triple entente,"" and ""arms race.""
   - These terms are used appropriately and demonstrate a good understanding of the historical context.

**Conclusion:**
- The student demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, though there are some errors.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning, but there are some awkward phrases and minor grammatical issues.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

This imagery suggests that the Bolsheviks are betraying Russia by aligning with Germany. The title ""Betrayed"" reinforces this notion of treachery. Contextually, this cartoon was published in December 1917, shortly after the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Following the revolution, Lenin and the Bolsheviks sought to withdraw Russia from the First World War, culminating in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, which made peace with Germany. This withdrawal allowed Germany to redirect its military efforts from the Eastern Front to the Western Front, thereby increasing pressure on the Allies.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B is useful to a historian learning about military technology and tactics because it shows a way how the British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C is useful because it tells us about an experience that a tank commander was stuck but seven whippet tanks came and pushed the German soldiers away.
This tells us that tanks were very useful and had a big impact on WWI. Tanks were bulletproof, destroy barbed wire and could drive over the enemy trenches. Since tanks could destroy barbed wire, this means that it can make paths for the British to attack the Germans.  ","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student notes that it shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage, which is a valid observation. For Source C, the student describes the usefulness of tanks in WWI, particularly the Whippet tanks, and their impact on the battlefield.

However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include extended reasoning or detailed contextual knowledge. The student does not evaluate the provenance of the sources or provide a more complex understanding of their utility. To reach a higher level, the student would need to incorporate more specific factual knowledge, evaluate the provenance, and provide a more nuanced analysis of how these sources contribute to understanding military technology and tactics in WWI.

This naval army caused a rivalry between Britain and Germany causing them to make lots of dreadnoughts which were barely used because of how costly they were. This caused them to fight and Britain won. The triple entente was made for assistance from the allies if one of them got attacked. ","The student provides a basic explanation of the Alliance System and its impact on the tensions leading to the First World War. They mention the formation of the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, and the naval arms race between Britain and Germany. However, the explanation lacks depth and detail, and there is no developed reasoning or complex explanation of the relationship between the alliances and the outbreak of the war.

The answer demonstrates some specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question, such as the formation of alliances and the naval arms race. However, the explanation is simple and does not provide a sustained line of reasoning or coherence. The student does not address other factors that contributed to the outbreak of the war, such as imperialism, nationalism, or the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 2 due to its simple explanation and specific knowledge.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, with only minor errors such as ""decently"" instead of ""definitely.""
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, with appropriate use of commas and periods. However, there are a few areas where punctuation could be improved for clarity, such as adding commas to separate clauses more effectively.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student demonstrates a good control of grammar overall. The sentences are coherent and the meaning is generally clear.
   - There are minor grammatical issues, such as ""Naval army"" which should be ""navy"" and ""This caused them to fight and Britain won,"" which could be more clearly expressed.
   - Despite these minor issues, the errors do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""allies,"" ""triple entente,"" ""naval army,"" and ""dreadnoughts.""
   - The range of specialist terms is good, though not particularly wide.

**Conclusion:**
- The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though not with the consistent accuracy required for Level 1.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning, with minor errors that do not significantly hinder understanding.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms, though not a wide range.

1. **Identification of an advantage:**
   - The answer does not clearly identify a specific advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The statement ""you can have independence and you can be your own boss"" is more general and not specific to a private limited company. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

2. **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
   - The explanation provided is vague and does not clearly relate to the specific advantages of a private limited company. The statement ""you can sell privately to any other you like"" is not accurate in the context of a private limited company, as shares are typically sold to family and friends, not the general public. The phrase ""If a private limited company you can get more advantages"" is too general and does not provide a clear explanation. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The explanation provided is somewhat unclear and does not directly link the use of the internet to the choice of business location. The candidate mentions using advertisements on social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, but this does not explain how the internet affects the physical location of the business. The statement ""The more populated the area the more sales the small business can gain and make profit"" is more about the benefits of a populated area rather than how the internet influences the location choice. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

### Mark Scheme Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - Correct formula: Break-even point = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Variable Costs)
   - Calculation: £10,000 ÷ (£6.50 – £2.50) = 2,500 units
   - Decrease: 4,000 – 2,500 = 1,500 units

2. **Final Answer:**
   - Decrease in break-even level of output: 1,500 units

### Provided Answer Analysis:
1. **Initial Calculation:**
   - 5.00 - 2.50 = 2.50
   - This step is incorrect because it uses the old selling price (£5.00) instead of the new selling price (£6.50).

2. **Break-even Calculation:**
   - 4000/650
   - This step is incorrect. The correct formula should be using the fixed costs and the difference between the new selling price and variable costs.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - 615.3846154
   - This is incorrect and does not follow from the correct formula.

### Grading:
- **Substitution into correct formula:** 0 marks (incorrect substitution and formula usage)
- **Final Answer:** 0 marks (incorrect final answer)

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""They would be following the law therefore they would be fully licensed and legal."" This satisfies the first marking criterion. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The explanation is somewhat present but lacks depth. The candidate mentions, ""If they were illegal then their business may of course get shut down,"" which implies avoiding legal issues and potential business closure. However, this explanation is not fully developed to show the broader implications, such as avoiding fines or maintaining a good reputation. The example given, ""a food business need to abide by law and be sanitary,"" is relevant but not fully explained in terms of the advantage it brings. **(1 mark)**

The value of the business may reduce as its employees don't get paid so they will quit their jobs there. So the business will get angry and not have a nice workplace.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one disadvantage'. The candidate has suggested a disadvantage through ""It is illegal to not pay employees."" This is developed through ""You may lose employees because the employment law says they have to be treated equally and get paid on time."" The candidate further develops their answer by stating, ""The value of the business may reduce as its employees don't get paid so they will quit their jobs there."" The final part, ""So the business will get angry and not have a nice workplace,"" is less clear but attempts to explain the impact on the work environment.

Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate identifies a disadvantage by stating, ""It is illegal to not pay employees."" This is a valid point, although it is more about the legal aspect rather than a direct disadvantage to the business. However, the subsequent point, ""You may lose employees,"" clearly identifies a disadvantage. This satisfies the criteria. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate explains the disadvantage by stating, ""You may lose employees because the employment law says they have to be treated equally and get paid on time."" This explanation links the legal requirement to the potential loss of employees. **(1 mark)**
  - The candidate further explains, ""The value of the business may reduce as its employees don't get paid so they will quit their jobs there."" This point extends the explanation by discussing the potential impact on the business's value and employee retention. **(1 mark)**
  - The final part, ""So the business will get angry and not have a nice workplace,"" is less clear and does not add significant value to the explanation. No additional mark is awarded for this part.

Overall, the candidate has identified a disadvantage and provided a clear explanation of the impact on employee retention and business value. The answer should be awarded 3 marks.

#### Identification of an Advantage
- **Criteria**: Identification of an advantage.
- **Response**: The answer does not clearly identify a specific advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. The statement ""Their profit that they get back will be useful to them"" is too vague and does not pinpoint a particular advantage.
- **Mark Awarded**: 0 marks. The candidate needs to explicitly state an advantage such as ""Retained profit is a cheap source of finance"" or ""Interest is not paid on retained profit.""

#### Explanation of the Advantage
- **Criteria**: Explaining the advantage.
- **Response**: The explanation provided is not clear or specific. The candidate mentions, ""They could keep that money saved for later or they could use it on their business to help it thrive,"" but this does not explain why retained profit is advantageous compared to other sources of finance.
- **Mark Awarded**: 0 marks. The candidate needs to explain why the identified advantage is beneficial, such as ""The business would not experience an increase in costs"" or ""Retained profit does not dilute the ownership of the business.""

The example of Polaroid is used to illustrate the concept of making a better version of an existing product, but the explanation lacks depth and clear connections to the benefits or drawbacks outlined in the mark scheme.

  - The answer mentions, ""Amelia could pinpoint how much she wants to charge for each thing she does."" This is a valid point as it relates to setting prices, which is a part of financial planning. However, it does not explicitly link to forecasting success.
  - The second part of the answer, ""She could also give discounts to loyal customers that would make more people love her,"" is more about marketing strategy rather than financial forecasting. It does not directly address how financial information helps forecast success.
  - The final part, ""She could plan this out,"" is vague and does not provide a clear link to financial forecasting.

  - The challenge of setting up a plumbing business in Birmingham, where competition is high, could be a driving force for Amelia (AO2).
  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).
  - As a result, she would be determined to succeed as there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. This could give her an extra incentive to do well. (AO3a).
  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

    - []","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","She could aim to have independence and she could be her own boss. And she could expand or grow her business to other people, that's why she would ask her customers to recommend her to their family and friends. She could also fulfil her dream to have her own company. She could pinpoint where she wants to aim and she could ensure aims to survive and help her business survive. She could also aim to gain more customers and make more loyal customers as well.
","The candidate's response identifies several non-financial aims that could impact Amelia's decision to start Lili Heating Ltd. However, the answer lacks depth and detailed development of these points.

1. **Independence and Being Her Own Boss:**
   - The candidate mentions that Amelia could aim to have independence and be her own boss. This aligns with the indicative content that suggests Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years. However, the response does not develop this point further to explain how this independence could impact her decision.

2. **Expansion and Customer Recommendations:**
   - The candidate states that Amelia could expand or grow her business and ask customers to recommend her to their family and friends. This point is relevant but lacks detailed explanation and logical chains of reasoning. The response does not connect this aim to the potential impact on Amelia's decision-making process.

3. **Fulfilling Her Dream:**
   - The candidate mentions that Amelia could fulfil her dream of having her own company. This is a valid point but is not developed further to explain how this dream could drive her decision to start the business.

4. **Aiming for Survival and Customer Loyalty:**
   - The candidate states that Amelia could aim to survive and gain more loyal customers. While these are valid aims, the response does not provide detailed interconnected points or logical chains of reasoning to explain how these aims impact her decision.

**Level and Mark Determination:**
- **Application of Knowledge and Understanding (AO2):** The response shows limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context. The points mentioned are relevant but lack depth and detailed development.

This depends on how well she does publicity.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria from the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states: ""She could use quality to try and do his. This depends on how well she does publicity.""
   - **Evaluation**: The answer does not clearly state one of the elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, or Price). The mention of ""quality"" is vague and does not directly correspond to any of the marketing mix elements. The reference to ""publicity"" could be interpreted as promotion, but it is not explicitly clear or well-articulated.
   - **Conclusion**: The answer does not satisfy this criterion.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1**: ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham.""
  - This example clearly identifies ""Place"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 2**: ""Promotion methods to attract female customers.""
  - This example clearly identifies ""Promotion"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 3**: ""Product is to repair/install boilers.""
  - This example clearly identifies ""Product"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Marking Notes

- **Application Evidence**: To award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
  - The given answer does not provide clear evidence of application to the context. The mention of ""quality"" and ""publicity"" is too vague and does not directly relate to the specific elements of the marketing mix in the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, the answer does not meet the criteria set out in the mark scheme. It fails to clearly state one element of the marketing mix and does not provide sufficient application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Lili Heating Ltd should choose option 2 because then Amelia can promote her prices and her work on different platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. She can also get online bookings. Amelia can also use payment platform online using e-commerce and on e-commerce she can then grow her business. She also has the advantage that she, as a woman, made this company believable.And how can he never things","The candidate suggests that Lili Heating Ltd should choose option 2, which involves using social media and e-commerce platforms. They mention the benefits of promoting prices and work on platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, as well as the potential for online bookings and payments. However, the response lacks depth and detailed application of business concepts (AO2). The points made are not interconnected with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a), and the judgement provided is simple with minimal justification (AO3b).

- **AO2 (Application of Knowledge and Understanding):** The candidate demonstrates a limited understanding of the business scenario. They mention social media and e-commerce but do not provide detailed application or context specific to Lili Heating Ltd. This places AO2 in Level 1.
- **AO3a (Analysis):** The analysis is basic and lacks interconnected points. The candidate does not deconstruct the business information in a detailed manner, and there are no logical chains of reasoning. This places AO3a in Level 1.
- **AO3b (Evaluation):** The judgement is simple and based on limited evaluation. The candidate does not provide a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made. This places AO3b in Level 1.

The business could fail and the investor would have a failed investment.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria and the context provided.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

#### Criteria: Stating one risk for investors in Ripple

- **Answer Evaluation**: The answer states, ""The business could fail and the investor would have a failed investment."" This directly addresses a potential risk for investors, which is the failure of the business leading to a loss of investment. This aligns with the example answer in the mark scheme: ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy (1).""

### Contextual Application

- **Context Evaluation**: The context mentions that Ripple is a consumer-owned wind farm providing green energy. The risk of business failure is relevant here, as the success of Ripple depends on the demand for renewable energy and the effective management of the wind farm. The answer's mention of business failure is applicable to the context of Ripple's operations and market conditions.

### Marking Notes

- **Evidence of Application**: The answer provides evidence of application by mentioning the potential failure of the business, which is a realistic risk for any investment, especially in a relatively new and evolving sector like renewable energy.

### Conclusion

- **Marks Awarded**: The answer successfully states a risk for investors in Ripple and provides evidence of application. Therefore, it meets the criteria for awarding 1 mark.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer does not clearly outline a specific benefit to customers of Ripple. The statement ""This is primary data that helps by knowing the demand not buying time"" is vague and does not directly address a benefit to the customers. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer lacks linked development and evidence of application. The statement ""This helps them get new ideas and objectives and help them to acknowledge their customers"" is not clearly linked to a specific benefit for the customers. It is more focused on the business's perspective rather than the customers'. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - Since the points are not linked and there is no clear benefit outlined for the customers, the answer can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. However, even for 1 mark, the answer should at least mention a benefit to the customers, which it does not.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

However, the application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts (AO2) is limited and lacks depth. The answer mentions the potential for business growth and job creation, but it does not provide detailed or specific contextual information about Ripple or the green energy sector.

The analysis (AO3a) is also limited. The candidate makes some connections between points, such as the benefit of free training attracting new employees and creating more job opportunities, but these points are not well-developed or logically interconnected. The reasoning is somewhat disjointed and lacks clarity.

The evaluation (AO3b) is present but simplistic. The candidate concludes that free training will help expand the business and create a better working environment, but this judgement is based on a limited evaluation of the information provided. The answer does not thoroughly evaluate the potential impact of the options on Ripple's success.

   - The conclusion is vague and does not offer a well-reasoned justification for the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B is useful to some extent as it only shows the use of the creeping barrage. This was used by the Allied forces to gain territory as artillery would fire shells infront of the tanks to hit the ground and form a shield of debris, the tanks would then cover the soldiers (soldiers would hide behind tanks for cover) and when they get close enough to enemy trenches, whatever enemy soldiers have not died to the bombardment of shells, would die from soldiers who would attack behind the tanks and tanks which would have machine guns attached to them.

Also source C is also useful as it highlights the role of tanks in the war. Tanks were used in the war to gain a lot of territory. In 1916, they broke down easily and were left on the battle field for the germans to steal and use. However, in 1917 they were made more reliable. They were used to go over barbed wire and to shield soldiers from machine gun fire. In this source, the whippets, fastest tanks, were smaller tanks that could go over barbed wire and also into enemy trenches without getting stuck. ","The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the content of both sources and provides some contextual knowledge about the use of military technology and tactics during the First World War. However, the evaluation of the sources is relatively simple and lacks depth.

For Source B, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and how it was used to protect advancing soldiers. They mention the role of tanks and artillery but do not provide a detailed evaluation of the source's utility. The explanation is more descriptive than evaluative, and there is no mention of the provenance of the source, which is necessary for a higher-level response.

For Source C, the student describes the role of tanks, particularly the Whippets, in the war. They provide some contextual knowledge about the development and use of tanks but again, the evaluation is simple. The student does not fully explore the provenance of the source or its implications for its utility to a historian.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of both sources, considering both content and provenance. They should also evaluate the relationship between the sources and how they together provide a more comprehensive understanding of military technology and tactics during the First World War.

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{New break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculating the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's evaluate the student's answer:

- The student provided the final answer as ""6000 units"" without showing any working steps.

  example_answer: []",,"In 1914, Schlieffen sent out soldiers to attack France through Belgium. He wanted to prevent a war on two fronts, as a result of this, he hoped to defeat France in 10 days and focus all his power to Russia on the eastern front as he thought Russia would take weeks to mobilise their forces. I chimmy was part of the British expeditionary forces (BEF) and due to the treaty we signed with Russia, me and my men were sent to Belgium to hold the line at the border, so that Germany would not have victory. German men had very poor co-ordination as they did not expect the Belgians to prepare. They were met with barricades of sandbags and light gun fire. As we got there, we set our machine guns and blew up bridges to stop the Germans from getting to France. Around 120,000 men came with me and around 500 came back. But we were able to hold back the Germans for weeks which gave the Russia, who the Germans thought would mobilise later, day to mobilise causing Germany to split their troops and fight a war on two fronts. If the Germans never decided to attack France through Belgium millions of lives could have been save.","The student begins by identifying the key elements of the Schlieffen Plan and its objectives, which moves the answer beyond level 1. The narrative is structured and demonstrates specific knowledge, such as the plan to attack France through Belgium and the expectation that Russia would take weeks to mobilize. This places the answer into level 2.

The student provides some factual details, such as the involvement of the British Expeditionary Forces (BEF) and the resistance faced by the Germans in Belgium. However, the answer lacks a developed analysis of causation and consequence. The narrative is somewhat disjointed, and the inclusion of a personal anecdote (""I chimmy was part of the British expeditionary forces"") detracts from the historical analysis.

To reach level 3, the student would need to provide a more structured and well-ordered narrative that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. This would include a developed analysis of how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a stalemate on the Western Front and the broader implications for the war.

#### Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark
- The answer identifies a disadvantage: ""The employees could sue or take the business to court for violating the terms of employment law."" This clearly states a potential negative consequence of not paying employees on time. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

#### Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks
- The explanation is partially developed: ""which means the business could be fined."" This provides a direct consequence of the identified disadvantage, explaining the potential financial penalty the business might face. However, the explanation could be further developed to include additional impacts, such as legal costs, damage to reputation, or operational disruptions.

#### Identification of an advantage:
- **Criteria**: Identification of an advantage.
- **Response**: ""They don't have to pay interest.""
- **Evaluation**: The answer successfully identifies an advantage of using retained profit, which is that interest is not paid. This matches the example answer ""Interest is not paid on retained profit.""
- **Mark**: 1 mark.

#### Explaining the advantage:
- **Criteria**: Explaining the advantage.
- **Response**: ""can keep the profit that they have already made instead of borrowing money from the bank and having to pay more than they had already initially borrowed.""
- **Evaluation**: The explanation provided is clear and logical. It explains that by using retained profit, the business avoids borrowing from the bank and thus avoids paying interest, which would result in paying more than the initial amount borrowed. This aligns with the example answer ""The business would not experience an increase in costs.""

    - N/A",,"I partly agree because, the alliance system caused tensions between countries e.g. Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia. It made one country want to be better than the other and so if Germany mobilized their Panzer, Britain would build a dreadnought and then Germany would build a replica and give it a different name. However, the July Crisis was one of the main causes of the war. Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by a group called the black hand gang this caused tension in Serbia as the Austro-Hungarian Government forced information out of some members of the Black Hand which gave links to Serbia supplying the black hand with weapons and information. 
The Serbian government were passed laws that they had to follow. They followed all of them but one which stated that Austro-Hungary police was allowed in the Serbian streets to patrol. As Serbia rejected this, Austro-Hungary declared war on them. This caused Germany to pledge support to Austro-Hungary (A.H). This led to Russia declaring war on Germany and due to the alliance that France had with Russia, they were forced to join the war and declared war on Germany.
By this point Britain had not yet declared war on anyone. However, Germany due to the Schliefen plan were going to attack France through Belgium and considering the Britain treaty with Belgium they declared war on Germany.
Also, the Moroccan crises was another main reason for World war one starting because, 
France had just humiliated Germany by securing Morocco as an ally. However, due to the Kaisers temper and need for revenge, he was willing to jump at any chance thrown at him to go to war with France because he wanted revenge on France for securing an ally that Germany needed for resources.
The alliance system did cause tension between countries involved in the war, but if Franz Ferdinand was not assassinated, World War One may never have started.","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the alliance system, and explains how it caused tensions between countries. They provide specific examples, such as the arms race between Britain and Germany, which demonstrates accurate knowledge and understanding. However, the explanation is somewhat brief and lacks depth, which limits it to a simple explanation rather than a developed one.

The student then moves on to explain the July Crisis and the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, providing a detailed account of the events that followed. This explanation includes the involvement of the Black Hand gang, the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia, and the subsequent declarations of war by various countries. This section demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding and provides a developed explanation of another factor, placing the answer into level 3.

The student also mentions the Moroccan crises as another reason for the war, explaining how the Kaiser's desire for revenge against France contributed to the tensions. This is another relevant factor, but the explanation is brief and lacks the depth needed for a developed explanation.

The conclusion attempts to make a judgement by stating that the alliance system caused tension, but the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was a more immediate cause of the war. However, the conclusion is not fully substantiated and does not provide a complex, sustained line of reasoning.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding and provides developed explanations of multiple factors.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""They could know if they need an overdraft or not."" This is a valid point as it indicates that financial information can help determine the need for an overdraft, which is a way to forecast financial needs and potential success. This satisfies the criteria of outlining a way financial information could help forecast success.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer does not provide linked development. It only states a single point without further explanation or development. For example, it does not explain how knowing the need for an overdraft could help forecast success or manage cash flow. Therefore, the points are not linked, and this criterion is not fully satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked, the answer can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide linked points with development, such as explaining how a cash-flow forecast ensures there is always enough cash to pay for supplies or how a break-even forecast sets a target for profitability. The given answer lacks this level of detail and linkage.

It made one country want to be better than the other and so if Germany mobilized their Panzer, Britain would build a dreadnought and then Germany would build a replica and give it a different name. However, the July Crisis was one of the main causes of the war. Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by a group called the black hand gang this caused tension in Serbia as the Austro-Hungarian Government forced information out of some members of the Black Hand which gave links to Serbia supplying the black hand with weapons and information. 
The Serbian government were passed laws that they had to follow. They followed all of them but one which stated that Austro-Hungary police was allowed in the Serbian streets to patrol. As Serbia rejected this, Austro-Hungary declared war on them. This caused Germany to pledge support to Austro-Hungary (A.H). This led to Russia declaring war on Germany and due to the alliance that France had with Russia, they were forced to join the war and declared war on Germany.
By this point Britain had not yet declared war on anyone. However, Germany due to the Schliefen plan were going to attack France through Belgium and considering the Britain treaty with Belgium they declared war on Germany.
Also, the Moroccan crises was another main reason for World war one starting because, 
France had just humiliated Germany by securing Morocco as an ally. However, due to the Kaisers temper and need for revenge, he was willing to jump at any chance thrown at him to go to war with France because he wanted revenge on France for securing an ally that Germany needed for resources.
The alliance system did cause tension between countries involved in the war, but if Franz Ferdinand was not assassinated, World War One may never have started.","### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, including complex terms like ""mobilized,"" ""dreadnought,"" ""assassinated,"" and ""Schlieffen.""
   - There are minor punctuation errors, such as the unnecessary comma after ""agree"" in the first sentence and inconsistent use of commas in lists (e.g., ""Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia"" should have a comma after ""Italy"").
   - The student uses periods and commas correctly in most cases, but there are some run-on sentences that could benefit from better punctuation (e.g., ""Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by a group called the black hand gang this caused tension in Serbia..."").

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are a few instances where the control of meaning could be improved. For example, ""The Serbian government were passed laws that they had to follow"" should be ""The Serbian government was passed laws that it had to follow.""
   - Another example is ""The alliance system did cause tension between countries involved in the war, but if Franz Ferdinand was not assassinated, World War One may never have started."" This sentence is grammatically correct but could be clearer with better punctuation or restructuring.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a wide range of specialist terms appropriately, such as ""alliance system,"" ""Panzer,"" ""dreadnought,"" ""July Crisis,"" ""Black Hand,"" ""Schlieffen plan,"" and ""Moroccan crises.""
   - These terms are used in the correct context and demonstrate a good understanding of the historical events discussed.

### Final Analysis:

- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though there are minor errors.
- **Grammar:** The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, though there are a few areas where clarity could be improved.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student uses a good range of specialist terms as appropriate.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student’s answer fits best in **Level 2**. The minor errors in punctuation and grammar prevent it from reaching Level 1, but the overall control of meaning and use of specialist terms are strong.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states ""product,"" which is indeed one of the elements of the marketing mix. This satisfies the basic requirement of the question.

### Application of Context

The marking notes specify that to award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application. The context provided includes specific details about Amelia's business, Lili Heating Ltd, such as the services offered (plumbing, repairs, and installations), the target market (female customers), and the unique selling point (being a female plumber).

- The answer ""product"" is a valid element of the marketing mix, but it lacks specific application to Lili Heating Ltd. For example, a more applied answer would be ""The product is to repair/install boilers,"" which directly relates to the services Amelia offers.

### Comparison with Example Answers

- The example answer ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1 mark) provides a clear application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- The given answer ""product"" does not provide this level of detail or application.

### Conclusion

The answer ""product"" correctly identifies an element of the marketing mix but does not provide the necessary application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for awarding a mark.

### Marks Awarded

- **0 marks**: The answer does not provide sufficient application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd as required by the marking notes.

The response lacks a clear connection between the success of Lili Heating Ltd and the government's objectives.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are not sufficiently linked. The response mentions the lack of women in the plumbing sector and the desire to have more women involved, but it does not explicitly connect this to why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. Therefore, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide clear reasons linked to the government's interest, such as tax collection and employment. The given answer does not clearly link the success of Lili Heating Ltd to a specific government interest, such as increased tax revenue or employment opportunities.

**Marking Notes:**
- The marking notes specify that to award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. The given answer does not meet this criterion as it lacks linked development.

**Total Marks:**
- Based on the marking criteria and the provided answer, the response should be awarded 1 mark. The answer provides a valid point but does not sufficiently link it to the government's interest in the success of Lili Heating Ltd.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Option 2 is the better option because it has very low risk. A lot of people use social media both for work and leisure and if she has adverts between YouTube videos or on a site, then more people would learn about her business and she can grow her business easier as they have more customers.

However if she chose to offer a discount to only the female customers, a lot of male customers could feel maltreated and not want to use her plumbing service as she only favours one gender and not the other. This leaves a gap in the market where another plumbing business could offer a discount for both male and female customers and then they will attract more customers.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 is the better choice, providing a rationale that social media has a broad reach and can help grow the business by attracting more customers. This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2) and is in the context of Amelia's business. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed application, which limits it to Level 2.

The candidate then considers the potential downside of Option 1, suggesting that offering discounts only to female customers could alienate male customers. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but the analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a). The candidate does not fully explore the implications or provide a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made.

Overall, the answer demonstrates sound understanding of the business scenario with some inconsistencies and provides interconnected points with some logical chains of reasoning. The judgement is justified based on a sound evaluation, but it lacks the detailed application and thorough evaluation required for Level 3.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",Business failure,"Let's evaluate the given answer ""Business failure"" against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer ""Business failure"" does state a risk for investors in Ripple. According to the mark scheme, an example answer that would receive a mark is ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy."" The given answer ""Business failure"" is a more general statement but still aligns with the idea of the business potentially failing, which is a risk for investors.
   - However, the mark scheme also requires evidence of application to award the mark. The answer ""Business failure"" does not provide any specific context or detail related to Ripple, such as why the business might fail (e.g., lack of demand, operational issues, etc.). The context provided mentions that Ripple's business plan fits with the UK government's cleaner energy strategy, which could imply a lower risk of failure due to supportive policies. Therefore, the answer lacks the necessary application to Ripple's specific situation.

### Conclusion:
- The answer ""Business failure"" does identify a risk but does not provide sufficient application to the context of Ripple. According to the marking notes, to award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application, which is missing in this case.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""Their customer needs can be met quicker instead of the business carrying out market research."" This implies a benefit to customers in terms of speed and efficiency in meeting their needs. However, the benefit is not explicitly clear or directly linked to the context of Ripple's operations. The mark scheme example answers focus on specific benefits such as receiving the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs. The provided answer lacks this specificity and direct relevance to Ripple's context.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer does not provide linked development or evidence of application specific to Ripple. The context mentions that Ripple asks questions to identify energy needs and then creates a green energy plan. The answer should ideally link the benefit of quicker need fulfillment to the creation of a tailored green energy plan or investment amount, as per the context. The answer does not achieve this linkage.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - Since the points are not linked and there is no clear development or application to Ripple's specific context, the answer can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It will also limit the business failure because there will be employees trained to fix any broken windmills and plant fruit and veg.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","The price payed by the customers could decide the amount of energy is operating in their home. Ripple claim to supply energy cheaper than its competitors, by doing this more people would pay for cheaper yet reliable energy as an investment into a business. They are paying for energy and are also investing in a business at the same time.

If the price of energy was too expensive, customers would go to Ripple's competitors and Ripple would not have the investment of a lot of customers to pay workers wages, improve the quality of the farm and the windmills. For example if another business comes to them and say they want to power a car showroom and they pay only £1,000, they will not have a lot of energy but if they offer £1,000,000 they will have enough energy and Ripple will be able to improve their facilities to make sure the energy that they are providing their customers with is the best.","The candidate begins by discussing the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix, noting that the price paid by customers determines the amount of energy they receive. This shows an understanding of the relationship between price and product offering, which aligns with AO1b criteria. The candidate also mentions that Ripple claims to supply energy cheaper than its competitors, which could attract more customers. This demonstrates some application of knowledge to the business context (AO2).

In the second paragraph, the candidate discusses the potential consequences of high prices, such as customers switching to competitors and Ripple losing investment. This shows an attempt to deconstruct business information and issues (AO3a). The candidate provides an example involving a car showroom, which adds some context but lacks detailed interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning.

The conclusion is implicit rather than explicit, and the evaluation is limited. The candidate makes a simple judgement about the importance of price but does not provide a thorough evaluation or clear justification based on the business information and issues (AO3b).

Overall, the response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with limited business terminology used. There is limited application of knowledge to the business context, and the deconstruction of business information and issues is basic. The conclusion is supported by generic assertions from limited evaluation.

Based on the mark scheme criteria, the response fits best in Level 1. The candidate demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding (AO1b), limited application to the business context (AO2), attempts to deconstruct business information with limited connections (AO3a), and draws a conclusion with generic assertions (AO3b).

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by

Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","These sources are very useful to an historian studying military technology and tactics during the first world war because it shows the benefits of the use of technology during battle and conflicts, if it wasn't for the newest and fastest tanks constructed by the use of modern and advanced technology, the soldiers stuck in the battle that were almost getting attacked in their tanks by the germans wouldn't have survived because as soon as the new tanks came racing into action and firing, the German soldiers threat was destroyed. This shows us how easier and efficient technology can be helping us against fighting during war. ","The student identifies relevant features of Source C, explaining how the new tanks, 'Whippets,' were effective in battle. However, the response lacks a detailed evaluation of Source B and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of both sources. The student does not address the provenance of either source, which is necessary for a higher-level response. Additionally, there is minimal contextual knowledge provided to support the evaluation.

To improve, the student should include an analysis of Source B, discussing how it shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage and what this indicates about military tactics. They should also evaluate the provenance of both sources, considering the reliability and perspective of the British newspaper and the first-hand account from a tank commander. More contextual knowledge about the development and use of tanks and artillery during the First World War would strengthen the response.

He planned that the German army would defeat the French army in 10 weeks and he knew that the Russia was going to back France but it was going to take a long time for the Russians army to mobilize. So the Germans start to invade France but to get to France they had to pass the Belgium border the Germans knew the British signed a treaty with Belgium that they were going to back Belgium in case of war. But the German general thought the British won't keep to the treaty so the Germans troops invaded Belgium. When the British realized what happen they were angry and was going to back Belgium so they sent a warning letter to the German emperor telling them to take all their troops of Belgium but the Germans keep ignoring the British. So Britain declared war on Germany. Immediately Britain troops got to Belgium and the British and Belgian troops fought against the German. But the Germans troops were too much Russia had mobilize his army in 10 days and they got sent to help the British in the war against the German. Which led for the German having a war on two fronts.,"The student provides a basic narrative of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond level 1 by identifying relevant events and demonstrating some understanding of causation and consequence. The answer is presented in a structured account, with a clear sequence of events, which places it in level 2. The student mentions the German invasion of Belgium, the British response, and the involvement of Russia, showing specific knowledge relevant to the question.

However, the analysis remains simple and lacks the depth and detail required for higher levels. The student does not fully develop the consequences of the Schlieffen Plan's failure, such as the resulting stalemate and trench warfare on the Western Front. To reach level 3, the student would need to provide a more developed analysis, supported by a range of accurate factual knowledge, and explain how these events led to problems in 1914.

This alliance was formed to protect each nation if any one of them got attacked by France. Austria-Hungary at the time was wanting to invade areas of the Balkans at the time because Germany always got their back, this made they feeling more brave so they annexed Bosnia this made Serbia so angry at Austria-Hungary and wanting to go to war with them because they were slavs in the same tradition with Russia and Bosnia but before going to war with Austria they needed the support of Russia. But Russia at the time did not want to go to war with Germany so they didn't interfere. The Austria-Hungary emperur Franz Archduke Ferdinand visited Serbia and got assassinated with his wife by a bosnia man this made the Austria - hungary government angry and they thought it was an act of war. So the Serbia government told the Austria - Hungary government that they will investigate the matter. But the Austria - Hungary government had sent an ultimatum to the Serbia government which said that the Austria - hungary police can go to Serbia and investigate. But the Serbia government rejected it because they didn't want their police in Serbia because they can be spies for their government when the Austria - hungary government found out their request hasn't been approved they cut all the information and communications going Serbia and declared war on Serbia.","The student provides a basic explanation of the alliance system, specifically the Triple Alliance, and its role in the lead-up to World War I. They mention the countries involved (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) and the purpose of the alliance. However, the explanation lacks depth and detail, and there is no mention of the Triple Entente, which is crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of the alliance system.

The student also touches on the annexation of Bosnia by Austria-Hungary and the resulting tensions with Serbia, leading to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. This is relevant to the question but is not fully developed or linked back to the alliance system in a meaningful way.

The explanation of the assassination and the subsequent events is somewhat disjointed and lacks clarity. The student mentions the ultimatum sent by Austria-Hungary to Serbia and the rejection of this ultimatum, leading to the declaration of war. However, the explanation is not well-structured and does not clearly connect these events to the broader context of the alliance system and its role in escalating the conflict.

Overall, the answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding of the factors leading to World War I but lacks the depth, coherence, and structure required for higher levels. The student does not provide a complex explanation or a sustained line of reasoning, and there is no attempt to compare the alliance system with other factors that contributed to the outbreak of the war.

Austria-Hungary at the time was wanting to invade areas of the Balkans at the time because Germany always got their back, this made they feeling more brave so they annexed Bosnia this made Serbia so angry at Austria-Hungary and wanting to go to war with them because they were slavs in the same tradition with Russia and Bosnia but before going to war with Austria they needed the support of Russia. But Russia at the time did not want to go to war with Germany so they didn't interfere. The Austria-Hungary emperur Franz Archduke Ferdinand visited Serbia and got assassinated with his wife by a bosnia man this made the Austria - hungary government angry and they thought it was an act of war. So the Serbia government told the Austria - Hungary government that they will investigate the matter. But the Austria - Hungary government had sent an ultimatum to the Serbia government which said that the Austria - hungary police can go to Serbia and investigate. But the Serbia government rejected it because they didn't want their police in Serbia because they can be spies for their government when the Austria - hungary government found out their request hasn't been approved they cut all the information and communications going Serbia and declared war on Serbia.","### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Spelling and Punctuation
1. **Spelling**:
   - ""know"" should be ""known"".
   - ""emperur"" should be ""emperor"".
   - ""bosnia"" should be ""Bosnian"".
   - ""hungary"" should be ""Hungary"" (multiple instances).
   - ""slavs"" should be ""Slavs"".
   - ""triple alliance"" should be ""Triple Alliance"".
   - ""Franz Archduke Ferdinand"" should be ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand"".

2. **Punctuation**:
   - Missing commas and periods in several places.
   - Inconsistent capitalization of ""Austria-Hungary"".
   - ""Austria - hungary"" should be ""Austria-Hungary"" (multiple instances).
   - ""Serbia government"" should be ""Serbian government"".
   - ""Austria - hungary police"" should be ""Austria-Hungary police"".
   - ""Austria - hungary government"" should be ""Austria-Hungary government"".
   - ""communications going Serbia"" should be ""communications going to Serbia"".

#### Grammar
1. **Sentence Structure**:
   - Several run-on sentences that could be broken down for clarity.
   - ""This made they feeling more brave"" should be ""This made them feel braver"".
   - ""wanting to invade areas of the Balkans at the time because Germany always got their back"" should be ""wanted to invade areas of the Balkans because Germany always had their back"".
   - ""this made Serbia so angry at Austria-Hungary and wanting to go to war with them"" should be ""this made Serbia very angry at Austria-Hungary and want to go to war with them"".
   - ""But Russia at the time did not want to go to war with Germany so they didn't interfere"" should be ""However, Russia at the time did not want to go to war with Germany, so they didn't interfere"".
   - ""this made the Austria - hungary government angry and they thought it was an act of war"" should be ""this made the Austria-Hungary government angry, and they thought it was an act of war"".
   - ""But the Austria - Hungary government had sent an ultimatum to the Serbia government which said that the Austria - hungary police can go to Serbia and investigate"" should be ""But the Austria-Hungary government sent an ultimatum to the Serbian government, stating that the Austria-Hungary police could go to Serbia and investigate"".

2. **Control of Meaning**:
   - The overall meaning is generally clear, but the numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing hinder the flow and clarity of the response.

#### Use of Specialist Terms
- The response uses several specialist terms such as ""Triple Alliance"", ""Balkans"", ""annexed"", ""ultimatum"", and ""assassinated"". However, the range is not particularly wide, and some terms are used incorrectly or awkwardly.

### Final Assessment
Based on the criteria provided in the Mark Scheme:

- **Spelling and Punctuation**: The response has several spelling and punctuation errors, but they do not severely hinder the meaning.
- **Grammar**: The response shows some control of meaning, but the numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing affect the clarity.
- **Specialist Terms**: The response uses a limited range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the forgiving nature of the grading and the overall effort to convey the historical context, the response fits best in **Level 3**.

  - The challenge of setting up a plumbing business in Birmingham, where competition is high, could be a driving force for Amelia (AO2).
  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).

  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",,No Answer is provided.
