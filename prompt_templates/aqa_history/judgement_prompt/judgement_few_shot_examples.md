    - The territorial terms of the Treaty of Versailles were the main reason why Germany hated it because they were humiliating and economically damaging. 10% of its land was given to neighbouring countries. A strip of land was given to Poland which effectively split Germany in two by creating a corridor that created access to the sea. As well as losing land outright, Germany also lost control of areas such as the coal rich Saarland which was put under a League of Nations mandate for 15 years and the Rhineland was demilitarised.
    - The reparations payments were another reason why Germans hated the Treaty of Versailles because it would make it harder for Germany to recover. People were suffering from starvation after the war, and they were angry that the reparation bill was so huge. Germany had to pay money to the Allies for the damage caused during the war. It was estimated that it would take over 60 years to pay back the full bill.

## Answer:
I disagree with this statement as the loss of territory was a big reason why the Germans hated
the Treaty of Versailles, but it was not the worst sanction.
Arguably, the worst sanction for Germany was the reparations Germany had to pay which
equated to 6.6 billion which would later cripple Germany’s economy. This would leave
Germany’s people in a state of depression and make them a poor country.
Another bad sanction of the Treaty of Versailles would be the loss of Army. Germany’s army
was decreased to only 100,000 men, no airforce and only 1 submarine.
This was crippling for Germany as it lost them open for attack and making them way less
powerful. This sanction also meant that Britain had naval supremacy.
Furthermore another sanction was that Germany had to take blame for starting the world
war. (Article 231) so if it wasn’t bad enough that Germany lost all of its money and majority of
its Army, they also had to take the blame for the war which left a lot of the German’s furious.
Overall, I disagree with the statement as the other sanctions were way more serious than just
the loss of land.

## Response:
The student moves beyond the ‘basic explanation’ of level 1, as they go beyond a stating of a factor to show some ‘specific knowledge and understanding’ of the factors, required for level 2. This is shown in the response in the second paragraph where the amount of the reparations is given and the impact of this is explained ‘This would leave Germany’s people in a state of depression and make them a poor country.’ This is a simple explanation and does not reach the ‘developed explanation’ needed for level 3. 
Further level 2 points are made, showing knowledge about the military restrictions in paragraph 3 ‘100,000 men, no airforce and only 1 submarine. This was crippling for Germany as…’ and in the explanation of article 231. Three different factors are mentioned (financial, military and blame) but each of these is dealt with briefly so the answer remains in level 2. Multiple level 2 paragraphs do not add up to make level 3.
Level 3 also requires the student to explain ‘the stated factor and other factor(s)’. The stated factor ‘loss of territory’ is briefly mentioned and dismissed in the first sentence, but no knowledge or understanding is shown of this, so the answer is limited to level 2. Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 6 marks.

## Answer:
I think the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty of Versailles was their loss of land.
I agree that the Germans hated the treaty of Versailles due to the loss of territory as the
Germans lost 10% of their land. They lost the Saar for 15 years as it was given control to
France and the League of Nations. The Saar was a large industrial part of Germany that would
of helped them pay their £6,600 million reparations. They only got it back 15 years later when
the plebiscite voted 90% for Germany. They also lost their colonies in Africa which were given
to Britain and provided them with lots of money and resources.
However their loss of military cover be the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty of
Versailles. Their army was reduced to 100,000 men and their navy reduced to 15,000. They
were not allowed an air force or submarines. The Rhineland was a strip of land on the border
of France and Germany and the treaty of Versailles made them demilitarise the Rhineland.
This left Germany feeling vulnerable to attack as it was well known that Georges Clemenceau
wanted revenge on Germany. This also led to Germans turning to Hitler as he promised a
strong army and rearmaments. He increased army to 1,000,000 and built his Luftwaffe This
aggression comes from their previous loss of their military.
Overall I believe that the loss of territory was the main reason for the Germans hatred of the
treaty of Versailles as they lost the large industrial Saar as well as their colonies and they lost
6,000,000 German speaking people due to the 10% of their land lost.

## Response:
The first paragraph addresses the ‘stated factor’ and is ‘supported by factual knowledge and understanding’, giving several examples of pieces of territory that were lost. However, the ‘developed reasoning’ required for level 3 is missing in this paragraph. To reach level 3, this paragraph would need to include an explanation of why those losses would make Germans hate the Treaty of Versailles. This is implied ‘provided them with lots of money and resources’ but not clearly explained. 
In the second paragraph, the ‘factual knowledge’ and ‘developed reasoning’ is evident, as the student provides factual details from the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and explains the impact of these on the Germans. ‘This left Germany feeling vulnerable’. Developed explanation comes as they explain the longer term impact of this ‘This also led to Germans turning to Hitler’, ‘This aggression comes from their previous loss of their military’. This is a level 3 paragraph.
The conclusion makes a judgement, but is repetitive of earlier points. The quality of the conclusion is only relevant if an answer is secure in level 3, as a reasoned judgement is required for level 4 only. With one level 2 paragraph and one level 3 paragraph, this answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 7 marks.

## Answer:
On one hand, I can agree with this statement because in total 13% of Germany’s land was
given away and was taken. This meant that many German people and German speaking
people found themselves out of Germany. All of Germany’s colonies in Africa were taken away
as mandates but in reality, they were given to Britain and France. Additionally Alsace Lorraine
was returned to France and the Rhineland was demilitarised meaning even parts of Germany
itself wasn’t properly controlled by Germany. The Saar was also taken which contained lost of
industrial business. This meant that the once great power of Germany felt stripped of its
power and many German people were forced to be a part of another new country.
However, War guilt could be seen as the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty so
much because firstly, article 231, the war guilt clause pointed all the blame on Germany and
the German people. This made the German population feel humiliated and they thought it
was unfair because the Kaiser and the German government started the war, not the German
people and how that the Kaiser had been humiliated and fled to Holland and they had a new
Weimar republic, they believed that the blame shouldn’t solely be on Germany. The people of
Germany believe that the ‘November criminals’ signed the ‘diktat’ and it was their fault
however, they did not understand that the government did not have a choice and have to sign
the armistice or war would have continued.
The Germans also hated the reparations and restrictions from the military. Firstly the
Germans were made to pay £6.6 billion in reparations to pay for the damage of the war.
Germany was already struggling at the time (and people were homeless and dying of
starvation of starvation. These reparations mostly effected the people who were not to blame
for the war. Also the military, which used to be a proud part of Germany was restricted to
100,000 men, 6 battleships, 15,000 sailors in the navy, no airforce and no submarines. This
gave Britain naval supremacy which was humiliating for the Germans and only gave them
enough army to defend themselves.
What the Germans did not understand is that the treaty could have been much harsher, but
the humiliation of the war guilt was probably the main factor because it hit the German
people hard and made them outcasts to the rest of Europe and the fact that they were not
allowed to join the League of Nations probably made it worse for them. The Treaty of
Versailles should have been about the Government and the military leaders but instead it hit
the ordinary people the most.

## Response:
The student clearly shows developed explanation of the stated factor in the first paragraph and then two other factors. Each paragraph contains a range of ‘factual knowledge’ and ‘developed reasoning’ as the student explains why each factor would make the Germans hate the Treaty of Versailles. This puts the answer securely into level 3.
Level 4 requires ‘complex explanation’, a ‘logical structure’ and ‘sustained line of reasoning’ to form a ‘sustained judgement’. The conclusion is not a repetition of earlier points, it attempts to draw them together and consider the overall impact on the Germans and the injustice of the people being punished when the leaders were to blame. The theme of humiliation is sustained throughout ‘Germany felt stripped of its power’, ‘This made the German population feel humiliated’ ‘These reparations mostly affected the people who were not to blame for the war’, ‘which was humiliating for the Germans’. It is this sustained judgement and the recognition of the difference between the leaders and the people which puts this answer into level 4. The structure is clear and coherent but lacks some complexity and comparisons between different factors throughout, so wouldn’t reach the top of the level. Overall, this falls into level 4 and should be awarded 14 marks.

This affected the Cold War because it was a missed opportunity to have face-to-face discussions and reduce tension.
    - The Prague Spring was also a reason why tension developed during the 1960s because Soviet forces invaded Czechoslovakia and installed their own loyal government. Dubcek had introduced political reforms into Czechoslovakia by relaxing state control of the economy and the press. The USSR and the other Warsaw Pact leaders felt any reforms could damage the communist system as a whole. East–West tension increased when Western countries criticised the violent response from Moscow and called for the UN to condemn the USSR.

## Answer:
The U2 crisis was a major source of tension between USSR and the USA during the 1960’s. The U2 spy plane made USSR think that the USA was spying on them, which they were, and cause a major increase in the lack of trust between USA and USSR.
At the time of the U2 spy plane the space race was also going on at the same time. The space race took up major amounts of money for USA and USSR. The risk of USA finding out USSR secrets with the spy plane would mean major loss for the USSR.
Khrushchev was very worried about the plane so he shot it down. The pilot refused to say anything so he was killed.
The Space race was a major source of tension as it was a way to prove which leadership is strongest USA or USSR.
During the 1960s the Cuban Missile Crisis was also happening which was major tension as Cuba is just 90 miles off the coast of Florida and USSR control so close was very dangerous for the USA. During the CMC the world was at the closest point it has ever been to nuclear war.
I agree with this statement because the spy plane was a direct threat to the USSR and it caused huge tension between USA and USSR as it was clear evidence that USA had been spying on them and that the USA could have information about the amount of weapons they have and also the development of the space race in the USSR.

## Response:
The student addresses the ‘given factor’ (the U2 crisis), providing a brief summary of events and explaining the impact of this ‘a major increase in the lack of trust between USA and USSR’. They then go on to explain different alternative factors, the space race and the Cuban Missile Crisis, both accurate reasons why tension developed during the 1960s. The structure of the answer could open it up to level 3, but throughout the student displays ‘simple explanation’ rather than ‘developed explanation’. There is some ‘specific knowledge and understanding’ of each of the events, but this doesn’t develop into the ‘range of accurate knowledge’ required for level 3.
To get to level 3, the answer would need to be better structured, showing ‘coherence and logical structure’, as it is, the student moves between factors in a series of short paragraphs and flips between the U2 crisis and space race.  
There is a conclusion at the end of the answer, which makes a judgement but the conclusion is only really relevant to reach level 4 once level 3 has been secured, and as explained above, the answer falls short of level 3 in the depth of its explanations.
Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 7 marks.

## Answer:
During the 1960’s although the U2 Crisis did cause tension to develop between the East and the West. I think other factors like the Cuban Missile Crisis may have been the main reason for the development of tension between the two superpowers.
In 1960, an American pilot, Gary Powers – was flying the U2 spy plane over the USSR. This plane was shot down by the Soviets when it was flying closer to the ground and both Powers’ and the plan was captured. This all took place while the Paris peace summit was also ongoing. When America was questioned by the Soviet’s – for multiple days. Eisenhower lied and used the excuse that it was a weather plane and denied any wrongdoing or espionage. After a few days the Soviets assessed the wreckage of the U2 plane and discovered technology like cameras that could read a newspaper from 20,000 feet in the air – monitoring equipment and even a cyanide pill. All of this equipment indicated that it was in fact a spy plane and Eisenhower had lied to Khrushchev’s face. At the Paris peace summit talks Eisenhower then refused to apologise for the U2 spy plane which caused Khrushchev to walk out of the talks and ended the peace talks and ended any chance of the ‘thaw’. This increased tension as it was clear that espionage and spying had been taking place in the Soviet skies with all of the improved technology and Eisenhower had lied to Khrushchev and refused to show any remorse for their decisions showing that America did not feel in the wrong about the spying. This then infuriated the Soviet’s and increased the distrust between the two superpowers and led to a spike in tension.
On the other hand, events in 1962 led to a massive increase in tension during the event. In the early 1960’s Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba as a big communist believer. Geographically Cuba is quite near to the USA and was a big difference to the spread of communism in the East. Once the Soviet’s started to get involved with Castro and the leading of Cuba, America were seeing this as a failure of the Truman Doctrine and containment of Communism. During the Bay of Pigs – John. F. Kennedy decided that they were going to threaten to stop exporting their sugar supply that was mainly from Cuba and also started putting blockades up against any Soviet ships trying to enter. This event between John. F. Kennedy and Khrushchev was the closest the world had ever come to Nuclear war which would not just affect the two superpowers of USA and USSR but in fact the whole of the East and West. Although it never reached the extremity of Nuclear war because of the reminder and realisation of Mutually Assured Destruction, it was the highest that tension and the threat between the East and the West.
In conclusion, I believe that the U2 crisis was not the main reason for tension but actually the Cuban Missile Crisis as although there was a Test Ban treaty in 1963 during the Cuban Missile Crisis tension was at its highest than ever before and was not just affecting the two superpowers mainly like the U2 crisis but the whole of the East and West with threats of complete Nuclear War.

## Response:
The student starts with a brief introduction, which, although not required, helps to provide the sustained judgement which is aimed for in level 4.
Paragraph 1 explains the given factor in a developed way. There is a range of ‘accurate factual knowledge’ shown about the events and the student then explains how that led to an increase in tension ‘This increased tension as it was clear that espionage and spying had been taking place’; ‘this then infuriated the soviets and increased the distrust…. Led to a spike in tension’. This is a developed line of reasoning, with several aspects considered and the consequences taken to their conclusion.
Paragraph 2 explains an alternative factor – the Cuban Missile Crisis. Again, there is a range of ‘factual knowledge and understanding’ of events, however the explanation and focus on the issue of increased tension is weaker here, it is hinted at in the final sentence ‘it was the highest that tension and the threat between the East and the West’, however this is ‘simple explanation’. Level 2 allows for ‘coherent, structured, substantiated and explicitly relevant’ which this is. The second paragraph lacks the ‘developed sustained line of reasoning’ shown in paragraph 1. However, the presence of one level 3 paragraph puts the answer into level 3, even if the second paragraph is weaker.
The conclusion repeats the judgement made in the introduction, but as there isn’t two secure level 3 paragraphs, the quality of the conclusion isn’t relevant to the level attained and the points made are repeated from earlier paragraphs, rather than adding anything to the judgement.
Overall, the answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 8 marks.

  example_answers: 
    - The U2 Crisis was the main reason why tension developed between the East and West because once the spy plane had been captured by the Soviets, the American government lied about the purpose of the flight. They claimed it was simply conducting weather research. Khrushchev revealed the deception at the opening of the Paris Peace summit and when Eisenhower refused to apologise, the meeting was abandoned. This affected the Cold War because it was a missed opportunity to have face-to-face discussions and reduce tension.
    - The Prague Spring was also a reason why tension developed during the 1960s because Soviet forces invaded Czechoslovakia and installed their own loyal government. Dubcek had introduced political reforms into Czechoslovakia by relaxing state control of the economy and the press. The USSR and the other Warsaw Pact leaders felt any reforms could damage the communist system as a whole. East–West tension increased when Western countries criticised the violent response from Moscow and called for the UN to condemn the USSR.

## Answer:
One of the reasons for tensions developing between East and West during the 1960s was the U2 Crisis. This was because the U2 Crisis had the potential to damage relations irreparably. The U2 Crisis was where a US spy plane was spotted and shot down in Soviet territory. Eisenhower at first claimed that the plane was a weather plane, this was proven to be false, however, as there were cameras on the plane and the pilot, Gary Powers, was carrying a cynide pill. When America admitted to it being a spy plane no apology was given, nor was it promised to not happen again. This increased tensions as it led to Krushchev walking out of the Paris Peace Summit shortly after. While this crisis did develop tensions it did not increase them to the point of potential war and therefore it was not the main reason for tensions developing between East and West during the 1960s.
A final reason for tensions developing between East and West during the 1960’s was the Cuban Missile Crisis. This was because the Cuban Missile Crisis has the potential to cause a nuclear war. The Cuban Missile Crisis was where the USSR was found to be keeping weapons, like ICBMs in Cubs. This worried the USA as Cuba was extremely close to it compared to where the Soviet Union was to the USA. This meant that the Soviet Union could easily and quickly destroy USA cities due to the close range. The USA responded to this by causing what was essentially a naval quarantine on ships heading to Cuba where they would check the ships for military weapons before letting them through. At this point the USA had reached DEFCON 2, the highest risk of nuclear war it has ever seen. Thankfully, both sides decided to back down with the USSR removing its weapons from Cuba and the USA removing its weapons from Turkey. This was the main reason for tensions as it risked nuclear war.
Overall, the Cuban Missile Crisis was the main reason for tensions developing between East and West during the 1960s. While both the Berlin Wall and the O2 crisis did increase tensions, they did not raise them to the point that the Cuban Missile Crisis did, nor did they risk the total destruction that it did either therefore it was Cuba that was the main reason for tensions developing in the 1960’s. The Cuban Missile Crisis highlighted to potential that the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D) could become a reality.

## Response:
The student addresses the given factor in the first paragraph and shows a ‘range of accurate factual knowledge and understanding’ and a clear link to the question, with ‘this increased tensions as it led to…’. This paragraph then starts to develop a judgement by evaluating the severity of the risk and the tensions at this point. ‘it did not increase them to the point of potential war and therefore it was not the main reason….’. This sentence is a good indicator of a potential level 4 answer as the student is starting to build a sustained judgement and setting out criteria for a complex, sustained line of reasoning.
In paragraph 2 (it seems like a middle paragraph about the Berlin Wall may have been removed here to keep the answer to a reasonable length for the exercise), the student explains an alternative factor – the Cuban Missile Crisis. Again, there is factual knowledge demonstrated at a good level of detail. The student explains the level of tension ‘the USA had reached DEFCON 2’ and makes a judgement at the end of the paragraph ‘this was the main reason for tensions as it risked nuclear war’. This is a second level 3 paragraph.
The conclusion secures level 4 by comparing the relative severity of the different events ‘while both the Berlin Wall and the O2 crisis did raise tensions, they did not… risk the total destruction’ of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This line of reasoning has been sustained throughout the answer, and is then brought together in the conclusion.
Overall, this answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 15 marks.

    - The main reason the conflict continued in the 1960s was because the Vietcong successfully fought a guerrilla war. The Vietcong hung on the belts of the Americans. The Americans struggled to identify the enemy because they didn’t wear uniforms and hid in the jungle and launched ambush attacks. The Americans could not be seen to be losing so they kept sending more forces and used new methods of attack such as Agent Orange to clear the forest.

## Answer:
I do agree that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was the main reason as to why the conflict in Vietnam escalated. I do agree because the Gulf of Tonkin incident was when America had claimed that Vietnam attacked three of their battle ships. This had led to a right for America that if Vietnam attacked anymore aggression had happened then America attack. Therefore the next day in 1964, or 1965, everything had corrupted, this led to the declaration of war which was why the conflict in Vietnam had escalated in the 1960’s.
I do not agree that the Gulf of Tonkin was the main reason why the conflict escalated in Vietnam because another event had taken place called Dien Bien Phu. Dien Bien Phu was when the French army had got destroyed so it had meant that in result to this, led to the conflict in Vietnam to escalate in the 1960’s
I do agree with the statement because the Gulf of Tonkin had led to a Gulf of Tonkin resolution which was in 1964, when after the right of being able to attack, It led to the declaration of war, which was the main reason why the conflict in Vietnam had escalated very quickly.
I do not agree with this statement because another reason why the conflict in Vietnam escalated in the 1960’s was the Domino theory. This theory was about when if one country had fallen with communism others would go down as well with communism. This had led to a major escalation in Vietnam because the other countries didn’t want to be communist. To conclude this, I agree that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was the main reason as to why the conflict had escalated in Vietnam because it led to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution which was when they had declared war in the 1964 and was the main reason why the Vietnam War had escalated.

## Response:
The student addresses the given factor in paragraphs 1 and 3. They show some simple knowledge and explain how that caused escalation of the war in a simple way. They do not show confidence in the knowledge ‘in 1964 or 1965’, but they do make the link to the question explicit, so achieve level 2. They identify two other factors, Dien Bien Phu and the Domino Theory, but these are not relevant for the question and relate to the 1950s rather than the 1960s. The overall structure is good, but to achieve level 3, the student would need to explain further relevant factors and develop their points further.
Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be given 5 marks.

## Answer:
I agree with this statement that one of the main reasons that conflict escalated in Vietnam was because of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. The Gulf of Tonkin incident is where one of the USA ships, the Maddox, was attacked with missiles. American officials were told that this was an attack from North Vietnam which led to the US getting more involved in the war, from this point LBJ set up operation Rolling Thunder, a bombing campaign against North Vietnam. The use of chemical weapons and bombing lead to many North Vietnamese people livelihoods had been destroyed encouraging them to fight back.
However, I do think that there are other incidents that led to the increase in conflict such as Americas search and destroy tactics. This tactic was where Americans troops would search, raid, destroy and burn villages looking for Viet Cong members, this was difficult however because the Viet Cong didn’t were uniforms, so the US troops were killing innocent people. This led to many more Vietnamese people going into the jungle and joining the Viet Cong to fight against the Americans.
Furthermore, I think another incident that increase the conflict was the Tet Offensive and the My Lai Massacre in 1968. The My Lai Massacre was where some soldiers from US troops went to My Lai and slaughtered 400 innocent Vietnamese civilians however American officials tried to keep this secret until 1969. The unfair killings and treatment led to a lot of a ger and further tension in Vietnam, making them more determined to resist and win the war.
Lastly, another reason conflict started to escalate in the 1960’s was when Diem was in charge of South Vietnam. The USA chose Diem to be in charge because they felt like he could easily be manipulated and controlled, however he wasn’t, he ignored the Geneva agreement and rigged votes this meant that the south Vietnamese started to resist him. The Ho-Chi-Minh trail was erected to help supply them with supplies and resistant groups were set up such as the NLF who would fight and kill government officials involved with him. Eventually the US agreed to a coup being organised against him and he was assassinated in 1963.

## Response:
The student starts by explaining the given factor, and this is done in a developed way, with developed reasoning of why escalated the war supported by a range of factual knowledge about the Gulf of Tonkin incident and the US response. The warship and the bombing campaign are both correctly named and how it caused escalation is explained ‘which led to the US getting more involved’; ‘encouraging them to fight back’.
The student also explains other factors, relevant to the 1960s and the escalation of the war – the search and destroy tactics and the My Lai Massacre. These are both really part of the same second factor – the US tactics in Vietnam and the way that it increased opposition from the Vietnamese people. There is developed explanation and specific factual knowledge – for example, about the My Lai massacre. The explanation of a second factor places this answer into level 3.
A third factor is explained, though Diem was leader from 1955 so this is not really relevant to the question. There is no attempt to make a judgement in a conclusion, so this answer does not reach level 4.
Overall, the answer falls into level 3 and should be given 10 marks.

## Answer:
The Gulf of Tonkin incident was a significant reason for the rising conflict in Vietnam in the 1960s. This was an incident where, on the 4 August 1964, as US destroyer ship, ‘Maddox’, detected a North Vietnamese attack. However the captain who raised the alarm had doubts and saw his men may have read the sonar wrong, Nevertheless, on 7th August 1964, due to these reports, the government passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution giving US President Johnson the power to take any military action necessary to stop the spread of communism and the power of the North Vietnamese in Vietnam. This incident officially started the war allowing combat troops to be sent. Without this incident, combat troops may never have been sent to Vietnam and so it is extremely significant in it’s role as amplifying conflict.
Another reason why conflict escalated was due to international American politics in 1960’s. The president from 1963-68, Johnson, maintained an ant-communist stance and supported president Eisenhower, a previous president, in his idea of the domino theory. This was the idea that of one country fell to communism, every country around it would be affecting US trade. Because US hatred for communism was high, Johnson had to appear tough on communism to maintain public support. Additionally, to become president, weapons companies funded presidential campaigns in hope they will primary weapons providers in war. Thus, this theory of the Military Industrial Complex stakes that Johnson may have felt pressured to be involved in the war to make profit for these companies, appeasing big businesses. This internal American politics was an important driving force behind many of the American’s actions in Vietnam.
Conflict was also escalated due to the Viet Cong’s tactics, The Viet Cong were a guerilla force, fighting against the UIS and South Vietnamese army in the south. Their tactics were effective in disorientating the US as they had no uniform, no known headquarters, hid in jungles and tunnels they constructed. They also ambushed Americans accounting for 51% of US deaths and used booby traps like punji traps (sharpened bamboo in the ground covered with leaves). Booby traps accounted for 11% of US casualties and instilled widespread paranoia in the US soldiers leading to low morale. As a result, the American army found it difficult to progress against the Viet Cong and soldiers grew angry, in part leading to events like the My Lai Massacre on 16th March 1968 where US soldiers killed 500 people, mostly innocent women, children and elderly. The US also employed the use of agent orange, a chemical weapon, to attempt to burn the jungle so the Viet Cong would find it harder to hide, which destroyed acres of jungle. And they used operation Rolling Thunder to drop over a million tonnes of bombs on Vietnam. Thus, the Viet Cong’s tactics caused the Americans to act in desperation, killing civilians and destroying the county’s environment, in turn, leading to conflict developing as more Vietnamese civilians turned to the Viet Cong for support, and they were more resilient than ever in their drive for liberation due to the oppressive, violent nature of the Americans and their attempts to outsmart Viet Cong tactics.
To conclude, the Gulf of Tonkin incident was an important reason for conflict amplification. However, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which allowed for original conflict to begin, may not have been passed if it was not for internal American politics and US policy of containment which caused them to have destroyer ships in the Gulf in the first place as a threat to the communist north. Accordingly, the Viet Cong’s tactics lead to increased conflict in Vietnam, as the US restored to harsh tactics to devastate the country and lower support for the Viet Cong. This lengthened the period of the war as the Viet Cong did not give up as easily as the US had hoped. However, America would not be using such harsh tactics or be in Vietnam to begin with, again, if it was not for the US negative attitudes to communism, and for politicians’ need to show that they will be harsh against communism leading to their use of chemical warfare in retaliation and mass bombing campaigns.

## Response:
The student addresses the given factor in the first paragraph and supports their reasoning with detailed factual knowledge about the incident and the US response. There is complex evaluation of the importance of this factor ‘without this incident, combat troops may never have been sent to Vietnam.’
The second paragraph shows complex explanation of a second factor and detailed factual knowledge and understanding of the US political situation at the time. The impact of the politics on the Vietnam War is explained, with different aspects considered, showing a high level of complexity. There is some evaluation of the importance of this ‘an important driving force behind many of the American’s actions in Vietnam’.
The third paragraph explains the tactics of the Viet Cong, again supported by factual knowledge and understanding and developed explanation of the US response to these tactics is shown. Specific factual details about the VietCong tactics and the My Lai Massacre elevate the answer and there is explicit focus on the question ‘leading to conflict developing…’. With three factors explained in a developed way, this answer clearly sits in level 3.
The conclusion then secures level 4. Each of the factors are evaluated and compared and the complex relationship between them is explained, to lead to a sustained and substantiated judgement. The conclusion creates an argument with phrases such as ‘may not have been passed if it was not for…’, ‘this lengthened the period of the war’, ‘if it was not for the US negative attitudes…’.
Overall, this answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 16 marks.

## Answer:
The Iran Iraq War began in 1980 with an Iraq offensive on Iranian forces, this was because of trade, land and religious sectarian disputes between the two nations. However also because of the Iranian revolution in 1998 which was supported by Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini. He wanted the Shia belief to spread across the Arab world so he could have a larger theocracy. This revolution led to a threat of uprising for Saddam Hussein who was the Iraqi leader and a Sunni Muslim. Iraq was a largely Shia population as well. So, to prevent an attack on Iraq, Saddam decided to strike first on Iranian forces to show strength and unite his nation against a common cause.
The war lasted 8 years (1980-88) and many conflicts and disputes were inconclusive on resolving dilemmas over trade, oil and land control. Iraq suffered 5 hundred thousand casualties as a result of the war, and also was left in a debt of $8 billion to several counties across the world. Iraq also had trade and military sanctions placed on them by the UN, meaning other countries were reluctant to trade and import goods to Iraq. This left Iraq in a state of bankruptcy an extreme poverty. Because not only was Iraq deprived of goods, but also not allowed to extract large amounts of oil had. This resulted losing more than 50% of it’s income. Therefore this created tension in the gulf because Iraq were in turmoil and needed a way out which posed a threat to neighboring countries such as Kuwait who could not defend and Iraq invasion to steal resources like oil.
Iran suffered 1 million casualties and were on the verge of bankruptcy after 8 years of fighting, this meant that their country was now in deep poverty and dismay. Furthermore, there was unrest in the country because of the difficulty period and lack of progress from the war, meaning there could have been an uprising at any moment. Many Iranian and Iraqi lives were lost over the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway (a thin strip of trade route bordering Iran and Iraq) yet the control over the area was still disputed by the two countries creating tension in the gulf even after 8 years of fighting.

## Response:
The student shows detailed factual knowledge about the Iran-Iraq War and the consequences of this. They address the question directly in paragraph 2 ‘this created tension in the gulf because…’. There is a good range of factual knowledge and understanding shown throughout. However, the answer is capped at level 2 as the student only addresses the given factor and doesn’t explain any other causes of tension in their answer. To reach level 3, the student must address the stated factor and another factor.
Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 8 marks.

## Answer:
I strongly agree with this statement as everything after the Iran-Iraq war was a knock-on effect from Saddam’s failure. His economy was ruined by the war so he tried to get Kuwait to increase their oil prices so that he could then do the same, allowing for Iraq’s economy to rebuild. Their refusal was what caused Saddam to annex them, causing the 1990 Gulf War. This war then caused religious massacres which caused a huge amount of tension among religious groups, many of whom were also angry at the West after their failure to kill or capture Saddam.
Furthermore, many nations were worried that Saddam would target them, particularly Saudi Arabia as they were world leaders in the Oil market. All neighboring countries were scared and with Iraq being landlocked, surrounded by nations whose economics were comprised of Oil trading, it led to unprecedented tension, Things only worsened after the 9/11 attacks, orchestrated by Osama Bin laden who had previously supported America. His change in attitude towards west was likely due to Saddam not being punished over the war and genocides.
Osama then evaded US troops for a decade, causing America to ignite a second Gulf War which used a forged piece of evidence on Saddam breaking the peace treaty as a basis for the invasion. This angered Gulf citizens as the invasion was without justification. Even after Saddam was killed, America and other allied nations continued to occupy middle eastern nations, leading to constant battle and many defeats. Gulf citizens blamed the wets due to the usage of fake evidence for the occupation.
In conclusion, the Iran-Iraq war led to a two-decade war, the largest terrorist attacks ever seen, multiple genocides, invasions and occupations and the biggest political scandal of the 21st century. The fact that all these atrocities stemmed from the embers of the Iran-Iraq war leads me to conclude that it was responsible for an overwhelming amount of tension in the Gulf.

## Response:
The student clearly explains the impact of the Iran-Iraq War and supports this with factual knowledge and understanding. There is a clear attempt to make a judgement at the start ‘everything after the Iran-Iraq War was a knock-on effect from Saddam’s failure.’ The religious and economic consequences are explained.
The second paragraph explains how other countries feared being attacked, particularly due to tensions over the oil market. This is a brief explanation of another factor and so places the answer into level 3.
The discussion of 9/11 and its consequences, although well explained, is not relevant to the question, which specifies 1990. Therefore the second half of paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 are not credited. There is a clear judgement made in the conclusion.
Overall, there is one developed explanation of the stated factor, plus a second factor briefly explained so the answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 9 marks.

## Answer:
I agree to a certain extent that the Iran-Iraq War was the main reason for tension in the Gulf in 1990, although a very important reason, it is a combination of multiple factors such as the Israeli Palestine conflict, Saddam Hussein wanting to develop a larger international reputation and American troops being stationed in Saudi Arabia.
One reason for the tension in the Gulf was the consequences of the Iran-Iraq War from 1980- 1988. The war ended in a stalemate which means that neither side gained anything. Both sides lost millions of dollars of money and casualties. The issue hadn’t been resolved which means the tension between the two was now at an all time high. The Iran-Iraq war also split the Arab countries public opinion with some countries supporting Iraq (US + western countries) and some supporting Iran (Pakistan). The US also played a big part is the Iran-Iraq War with supplying weapons to Iraq (publicly) and to Iran (privately) This means that both countries were weaker so America could maintain its global hold on the Middle East and its oil.
Although the Iran-Iraq War was a more important reason the continued Israeli-Palestine conflict was still dividing the Middle East’s public opinion. After being establish in the mid 1900’s its existence was born challenged territorially (by Palestine because some of Palestines land was taken away) and religiously because Israel is a Jewish country. There has been constant Israeli-Palestine conflict since its founding which means different countries in the Middle East have different opinions. Israel is supported by US + Western countries and Palestine being supported by Iraq + Pakistan. This tension was escalated by the continued unwanted influence of the US troops and government.
The main reason for tension in the Gulf in 1990 was Saddam Hussein (leader of Iraq) wanted to extend his global territory and wanted a better international relationship because he was seen as weak internationally after the Iran-Iraq War. This means that Saddam aimed to invade Kuwait. This was the pinnacle of tension in the Gulf. There was a UN coalition formed and Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield commenced in 1991. Saddam aimed to get rid of his debt and claimed that Kuwait was historically part of Iraq. This meant that another war had been broken out in an already fractured and crumbled Middle East. This was where the most tension came from.
In conclusion the main reason for tension and conflict in the Gulf in 1990 was Saddam’s global policy of wanting to extend his power and reach and boost his reputation after the bad outcome of the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988. The Israeli-Palestine conflict contributed to this and America’s constant influence on the region only heightened the already high tensions.

## Response:
This is a well-structured answer with a sustained judgement, as the student sets out their argument in a brief introduction and evaluates each factor at the end of each paragraph. The first paragraph explains the stated factor. There is a good range of accurate knowledge and understanding shown and a clear explanation of how this increased tension in 1990.
The second paragraph explains a second factor – ‘the Israeli-Palestine conflict’ – again showing a good range of factual knowledge and clearly explaining the ways that tension was increased. The knowledge could be developed further here with more specific detail. The third paragraph explains a third factor -  Saddam Hussein’s desire to extend his global territory – and the invasion of Kuwait. The importance of this is clearly explained again, supported by factual knowledge. The judgement is sustained as the paragraph begins ‘the main reason for tension in the Gulf was..’, building the argument throughout the essay.
The conclusion repeats earlier points and clarifies the judgement made, making links between the factors. Overall, this answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 15 marks.
