What they hated the most about the Treaty of Versailles was that Germany was excluded from the negotiations and it was a ‘Diktat’.

    - The territorial terms of the Treaty of Versailles were the main reason why Germany hated it because they were humiliating and economically damaging. 10% of its land was given to neighbouring countries. A strip of land was given to Poland which effectively split Germany in two by creating a corridor that created access to the sea. As well as losing land outright, Germany also lost control of areas such as the coal rich Saarland which was put under a League of Nations mandate for 15 years and the Rhineland was demilitarised.
    - The reparations payments were another reason why Germans hated the Treaty of Versailles because it would make it harder for Germany to recover. People were suffering from starvation after the war, and they were angry that the reparation bill was so huge. Germany had to pay money to the Allies for the damage caused during the war. It was estimated that it would take over 60 years to pay back the full bill.

## Context:

## Answer:
I disagree with this statement as the loss of territory was a big reason why the Germans hated
the Treaty of Versailles, but it was not the worst sanction.
Arguably, the worst sanction for Germany was the reparations Germany had to pay which
equated to 6.6 billion which would later cripple Germany’s economy. This would leave
Germany’s people in a state of depression and make them a poor country.
Another bad sanction of the Treaty of Versailles would be the loss of Army. Germany’s army
was decreased to only 100,000 men, no airforce and only 1 submarine.
This was crippling for Germany as it lost them open for attack and making them way less
powerful. This sanction also meant that Britain had naval supremacy.
Furthermore another sanction was that Germany had to take blame for starting the world
war. (Article 231) so if it wasn’t bad enough that Germany lost all of its money and majority of
its Army, they also had to take the blame for the war which left a lot of the German’s furious.
Overall, I disagree with the statement as the other sanctions were way more serious than just
the loss of land.

## Response:
The student moves beyond the ‘basic explanation’ of level 1, as they go beyond a stating of a factor to show some ‘specific knowledge and understanding’ of the factors, required for level 2. This is shown in the response in the second paragraph where the amount of the reparations is given and the impact of this is explained ‘This would leave Germany’s people in a state of depression and make them a poor country.’ This is a simple explanation and does not reach the ‘developed explanation’ needed for level 3. 
Further level 2 points are made, showing knowledge about the military restrictions in paragraph 3 ‘100,000 men, no airforce and only 1 submarine. This was crippling for Germany as…’ and in the explanation of article 231. Three different factors are mentioned (financial, military and blame) but each of these is dealt with briefly so the answer remains in level 2. Multiple level 2 paragraphs do not add up to make level 3.
Level 3 also requires the student to explain ‘the stated factor and other factor(s)’. The stated factor ‘loss of territory’ is briefly mentioned and dismissed in the first sentence, but no knowledge or understanding is shown of this, so the answer is limited to level 2. Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 6 marks.

## Answer:
I think the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty of Versailles was their loss of land.
I agree that the Germans hated the treaty of Versailles due to the loss of territory as the
Germans lost 10% of their land. They lost the Saar for 15 years as it was given control to
France and the League of Nations. The Saar was a large industrial part of Germany that would
of helped them pay their £6,600 million reparations. They only got it back 15 years later when
the plebiscite voted 90% for Germany. They also lost their colonies in Africa which were given
to Britain and provided them with lots of money and resources.
However their loss of military cover be the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty of
Versailles. Their army was reduced to 100,000 men and their navy reduced to 15,000. They
were not allowed an air force or submarines. The Rhineland was a strip of land on the border
of France and Germany and the treaty of Versailles made them demilitarise the Rhineland.
This left Germany feeling vulnerable to attack as it was well known that Georges Clemenceau
wanted revenge on Germany. This also led to Germans turning to Hitler as he promised a
strong army and rearmaments. He increased army to 1,000,000 and built his Luftwaffe This
aggression comes from their previous loss of their military.
Overall I believe that the loss of territory was the main reason for the Germans hatred of the
treaty of Versailles as they lost the large industrial Saar as well as their colonies and they lost
6,000,000 German speaking people due to the 10% of their land lost.

## Response:
The first paragraph addresses the ‘stated factor’ and is ‘supported by factual knowledge and understanding’, giving several examples of pieces of territory that were lost. However, the ‘developed reasoning’ required for level 3 is missing in this paragraph. To reach level 3, this paragraph would need to include an explanation of why those losses would make Germans hate the Treaty of Versailles. This is implied ‘provided them with lots of money and resources’ but not clearly explained. 
In the second paragraph, the ‘factual knowledge’ and ‘developed reasoning’ is evident, as the student provides factual details from the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and explains the impact of these on the Germans. ‘This left Germany feeling vulnerable’. Developed explanation comes as they explain the longer term impact of this ‘This also led to Germans turning to Hitler’, ‘This aggression comes from their previous loss of their military’. This is a level 3 paragraph.
The conclusion makes a judgement, but is repetitive of earlier points. The quality of the conclusion is only relevant if an answer is secure in level 3, as a reasoned judgement is required for level 4 only. With one level 2 paragraph and one level 3 paragraph, this answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 7 marks.

## Answer:
On one hand, I can agree with this statement because in total 13% of Germany’s land was
given away and was taken. This meant that many German people and German speaking
people found themselves out of Germany. All of Germany’s colonies in Africa were taken away
as mandates but in reality, they were given to Britain and France. Additionally Alsace Lorraine
was returned to France and the Rhineland was demilitarised meaning even parts of Germany
itself wasn’t properly controlled by Germany. The Saar was also taken which contained lost of
industrial business. This meant that the once great power of Germany felt stripped of its
power and many German people were forced to be a part of another new country.
However, War guilt could be seen as the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty so
much because firstly, article 231, the war guilt clause pointed all the blame on Germany and
the German people. This made the German population feel humiliated and they thought it
was unfair because the Kaiser and the German government started the war, not the German
people and how that the Kaiser had been humiliated and fled to Holland and they had a new
Weimar republic, they believed that the blame shouldn’t solely be on Germany. The people of
Germany believe that the ‘November criminals’ signed the ‘diktat’ and it was their fault
however, they did not understand that the government did not have a choice and have to sign
the armistice or war would have continued.
The Germans also hated the reparations and restrictions from the military. Firstly the
Germans were made to pay £6.6 billion in reparations to pay for the damage of the war.
Germany was already struggling at the time (and people were homeless and dying of
starvation of starvation. These reparations mostly effected the people who were not to blame
for the war. Also the military, which used to be a proud part of Germany was restricted to
100,000 men, 6 battleships, 15,000 sailors in the navy, no airforce and no submarines. This
gave Britain naval supremacy which was humiliating for the Germans and only gave them
enough army to defend themselves.
What the Germans did not understand is that the treaty could have been much harsher, but
the humiliation of the war guilt was probably the main factor because it hit the German
people hard and made them outcasts to the rest of Europe and the fact that they were not
allowed to join the League of Nations probably made it worse for them. The Treaty of
Versailles should have been about the Government and the military leaders but instead it hit
the ordinary people the most.

## Response:
The student clearly shows developed explanation of the stated factor in the first paragraph and then two other factors. Each paragraph contains a range of ‘factual knowledge’ and ‘developed reasoning’ as the student explains why each factor would make the Germans hate the Treaty of Versailles. This puts the answer securely into level 3.
Level 4 requires ‘complex explanation’, a ‘logical structure’ and ‘sustained line of reasoning’ to form a ‘sustained judgement’. The conclusion is not a repetition of earlier points, it attempts to draw them together and consider the overall impact on the Germans and the injustice of the people being punished when the leaders were to blame. The theme of humiliation is sustained throughout ‘Germany felt stripped of its power’, ‘This made the German population feel humiliated’ ‘These reparations mostly affected the people who were not to blame for the war’, ‘which was humiliating for the Germans’. It is this sustained judgement and the recognition of the difference between the leaders and the people which puts this answer into level 4. The structure is clear and coherent but lacks some complexity and comparisons between different factors throughout, so wouldn’t reach the top of the level. Overall, this falls into level 4 and should be awarded 14 marks.
