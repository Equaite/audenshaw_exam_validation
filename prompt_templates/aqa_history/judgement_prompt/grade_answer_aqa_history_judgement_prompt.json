    "template": "Instruction: \nYou are an exam grader. Your task is to grade exam questions according to a given mark scheme. \n    You will be given a Question, Answer, Context and a Mark Scheme to grade the Answer.\n\n    Follow these detailed instructions:\n\n    1. **Understand the Levels and Descriptors:**\n    - Review the mark scheme to understand the different levels and their descriptors. Each level descriptor represents the average performance expected for that level.\n\n    2. **Annotate the Answer:**\n    - Read through the student\u2019s answer and annotate it based on the qualities outlined in the mark scheme. Highlight the key points that align with the descriptors.\n\n    3. **Determine a Level:**\n    - Start at the lowest level of the mark scheme and check if the answer meets the criteria for that level.\n    - If it does, move to the next level and repeat until you find the highest level the answer meets.\n    - Consider the overall quality of the answer, rather than focusing on minor errors.\n    - Use a best-fit approach if the answer includes elements from multiple levels, placing it in the level that best matches the predominant quality.\n\n    4. **Determine a Mark:**\n    - Once a level is assigned, decide on the specific mark within that level.\n    - Compare the student\u2019s answer to exemplar materials provided during standardization, which include answers with assigned marks by the Lead Examiner.\n    - Use these comparisons to judge if the student's answer is of the same, better, or worse standard than the example, and assign a mark accordingly.\n\n    5. **Use Indicative Content as a Guide:**\n    - The indicative content in the mark scheme is a guide and not exhaustive. Credit valid points made by the student even if they are not listed in the indicative content.\n    - Students do not need to cover all points in the indicative content to achieve the highest level.\n\n    6. **Award No Marks for Irrelevant Answers:**\n    - If an answer contains nothing relevant to the question, award zero marks.\n\n    7. **Review as Necessary:**\n    - Re-read the student\u2019s answer as needed to ensure the level and mark are appropriate and accurately reflect the answer\u2019s quality.\n\n    By following these steps, you can accurately grade student answers according to the mark scheme, ensuring consistency and fairness in the evaluation process. \n\n    Provide a thorough step-by-step explanation of your reasoning. \n    Below are some examples of how to grade student answers:\n\nQuestion:\n'The loss of territory was the main reason why Germans hated the Treaty of Versailles.'\nHow far do you agree with the statement.\nExplain your answer.\n\nMark Scheme:\nLevel_4:\n  description: \n    - Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to a sustained judgement\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 16\n    minimum: 13\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question\n    - Demonstrates a complex, sustained line of reasoning which has a sharply-focused coherence and logical structure that is fully substantiated, with well-judged relevance\n  progression: \n    - Extends Level 3\n    - Students may progress from a developed explanation of causation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes supported by detailed factual knowledge and understanding to form a sustained judgement\n  example_answers: \n    - The loss of territory was not the main reason because Germany expected some losses. What they hated the most about the Treaty of Versailles was that Germany was excluded from the negotiations and it was a \u2018Diktat\u2019. This meant they could not influence the severity of the resulting terms. This meant they could not prevent the inclusion of Clause 231 concerning war guilt which said they were responsible for starting the war.\n\nLevel_3:\n  description: \n    - Developed explanation of the stated factor and other factor(s)\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 12\n    minimum: 9\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question\n    - Demonstrates a developed, sustained line of reasoning which has coherence and logical structure; it is well substantiated, and with sustained, explicit relevance\n  progression: \n    - Extends Level 2\n    - Answer may suggest that one reason has greater merit\n    - Students may progress from a simple explanation of causation with developed reasoning supported by factual knowledge and understanding\n  example_answers: \n    - The territorial terms of the Treaty of Versailles were the main reason why Germany hated it because they were humiliating and economically damaging. 10% of its land was given to neighbouring countries. A strip of land was given to Poland which effectively split Germany in two by creating a corridor that created access to the sea. As well as losing land outright, Germany also lost control of areas such as the coal rich Saarland which was put under a League of Nations mandate for 15 years and the Rhineland was demilitarised.\n    - The reparations payments were another reason why Germans hated the Treaty of Versailles because it would make it harder for Germany to recover. People were suffering from starvation after the war, and they were angry that the reparation bill was so huge. Germany had to pay money to the Allies for the damage caused during the war. It was estimated that it would take over 60 years to pay back the full bill.\n\nLevel_2:\n  description: \n    - Simple explanation of stated factor or other factor(s)\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 8\n    minimum: 5\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question\n    - Demonstrates a simple, sustained line of reasoning which is coherent, structured, substantiated and explicitly relevant\n    - Answers arguing a preference for one judgement but with only basic explanation of another view will be marked at this level\n  progression: \n    - Students may progress from a basic explanation of causation by simple reasoning and supporting it with factual knowledge and understanding\n  example_answers: \n    - The War Guilt clause was hated by the German people because it forced them to accept the full blame for starting the war. Germany had no choice about signing the treaty; they were threatened with renewed fighting if they did not accept all the terms.\n\nLevel_1:\n  description: \n    - Basic explanation of one or more factors\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 4\n    minimum: 1\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question\n    - Demonstrates a basic line of reasoning, which is coherent, structured with some substantiation; the relevance might be implicit\n    - Students recognise and provide a basic explanation of one or more factors\n  example_answers: \n    - The Treaty of Versailles took a lot of land from Germany.\n    - Germany was humiliated and forced to reduce the size of its army.\n\nLevel_0:\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 0\n    minimum: 0\n  criteria:\n    - Students either submit no evidence or fail to address the question\n\nContext:\n\n\nAnswer:\nI disagree with this statement as the loss of territory was a big reason why the Germans hated\nthe Treaty of Versailles, but it was not the worst sanction.\nArguably, the worst sanction for Germany was the reparations Germany had to pay which\nequated to 6.6 billion which would later cripple Germany\u2019s economy. This would leave\nGermany\u2019s people in a state of depression and make them a poor country.\nAnother bad sanction of the Treaty of Versailles would be the loss of Army. Germany\u2019s army\nwas decreased to only 100,000 men, no airforce and only 1 submarine.\nThis was crippling for Germany as it lost them open for attack and making them way less\npowerful. This sanction also meant that Britain had naval supremacy.\nFurthermore another sanction was that Germany had to take blame for starting the world\nwar. (Article 231) so if it wasn\u2019t bad enough that Germany lost all of its money and majority of\nits Army, they also had to take the blame for the war which left a lot of the German\u2019s furious.\nOverall, I disagree with the statement as the other sanctions were way more serious than just\nthe loss of land.\n\nResponse:\nThe student moves beyond the \u2018basic explanation\u2019 of level 1, as they go beyond a stating of a factor to show some \u2018specific knowledge and understanding\u2019 of the factors, required for level 2. This is shown in the response in the second paragraph where the amount of the reparations is given and the impact of this is explained \u2018This would leave Germany\u2019s people in a state of depression and make them a poor country.\u2019 This is a simple explanation and does not reach the \u2018developed explanation\u2019 needed for level 3. \nFurther level 2 points are made, showing knowledge about the military restrictions in paragraph 3 \u2018100,000 men, no airforce and only 1 submarine. This was crippling for Germany as\u2026\u2019 and in the explanation of article 231. Three different factors are mentioned (financial, military and blame) but each of these is dealt with briefly so the answer remains in level 2. Multiple level 2 paragraphs do not add up to make level 3.\nLevel 3 also requires the student to explain \u2018the stated factor and other factor(s)\u2019. The stated factor \u2018loss of territory\u2019 is briefly mentioned and dismissed in the first sentence, but no knowledge or understanding is shown of this, so the answer is limited to level 2. Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 6 marks.\n\nQuestion:\n'The loss of territory was the main reason why Germans hated the Treaty of Versailles.'\nHow far do you agree with the statement.\nExplain your answer.\n\nMark Scheme:\nLevel_4:\n  description: \n    - Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to a sustained judgement\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 16\n    minimum: 13\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question\n    - Demonstrates a complex, sustained line of reasoning which has a sharply-focused coherence and logical structure that is fully substantiated, with well-judged relevance\n  progression: \n    - Extends Level 3\n    - Students may progress from a developed explanation of causation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes supported by detailed factual knowledge and understanding to form a sustained judgement\n  example_answers: \n    - The loss of territory was not the main reason because Germany expected some losses.

They lost the Saar for 15 years as it was given control to\nFrance and the League of Nations. The Saar was a large industrial part of Germany that would\nof helped them pay their \u00a36,600 million reparations. They only got it back 15 years later when\nthe plebiscite voted 90% for Germany. They also lost their colonies in Africa which were given\nto Britain and provided them with lots of money and resources.\nHowever their loss of military cover be the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty of\nVersailles. Their army was reduced to 100,000 men and their navy reduced to 15,000. They\nwere not allowed an air force or submarines. The Rhineland was a strip of land on the border\nof France and Germany and the treaty of Versailles made them demilitarise the Rhineland.\nThis left Germany feeling vulnerable to attack as it was well known that Georges Clemenceau\nwanted revenge on Germany. This also led to Germans turning to Hitler as he promised a\nstrong army and rearmaments. He increased army to 1,000,000 and built his Luftwaffe This\naggression comes from their previous loss of their military.\nOverall I believe that the loss of territory was the main reason for the Germans hatred of the\ntreaty of Versailles as they lost the large industrial Saar as well as their colonies and they lost\n6,000,000 German speaking people due to the 10% of their land lost.\n\nResponse:\nThe first paragraph addresses the \u2018stated factor\u2019 and is \u2018supported by factual knowledge and understanding\u2019, giving several examples of pieces of territory that were lost. However, the \u2018developed reasoning\u2019 required for level 3 is missing in this paragraph. To reach level 3, this paragraph would need to include an explanation of why those losses would make Germans hate the Treaty of Versailles. This is implied \u2018provided them with lots of money and resources\u2019 but not clearly explained. \nIn the second paragraph, the \u2018factual knowledge\u2019 and \u2018developed reasoning\u2019 is evident, as the student provides factual details from the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and explains the impact of these on the Germans. \u2018This left Germany feeling vulnerable\u2019. Developed explanation comes as they explain the longer term impact of this \u2018This also led to Germans turning to Hitler\u2019, \u2018This aggression comes from their previous loss of their military\u2019. This is a level 3 paragraph.\nThe conclusion makes a judgement, but is repetitive of earlier points. The quality of the conclusion is only relevant if an answer is secure in level 3, as a reasoned judgement is required for level 4 only. With one level 2 paragraph and one level 3 paragraph, this answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 7 marks.\n\nQuestion:\n'The loss of territory was the main reason why Germans hated the Treaty of Versailles.'\nHow far do you agree with the statement.\nExplain your answer.\n\nMark Scheme:\nLevel_4:\n  description: \n    - Complex explanation of stated factor and other factor(s) leading to a sustained judgement\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 16\n    minimum: 13\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question\n    - Demonstrates a complex, sustained line of reasoning which has a sharply-focused coherence and logical structure that is fully substantiated, with well-judged relevance\n  progression: \n    - Extends Level 3\n    - Students may progress from a developed explanation of causation by complex explanation of the relationship between causes supported by detailed factual knowledge and understanding to form a sustained judgement\n  example_answers: \n    - The loss of territory was not the main reason because Germany expected some losses.

This meant that many German people and German speaking\npeople found themselves out of Germany. All of Germany\u2019s colonies in Africa were taken away\nas mandates but in reality, they were given to Britain and France. Additionally Alsace Lorraine\nwas returned to France and the Rhineland was demilitarised meaning even parts of Germany\nitself wasn\u2019t properly controlled by Germany. The Saar was also taken which contained lost of\nindustrial business. This meant that the once great power of Germany felt stripped of its\npower and many German people were forced to be a part of another new country.\nHowever, War guilt could be seen as the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty so\nmuch because firstly, article 231, the war guilt clause pointed all the blame on Germany and\nthe German people. This made the German population feel humiliated and they thought it\nwas unfair because the Kaiser and the German government started the war, not the German\npeople and how that the Kaiser had been humiliated and fled to Holland and they had a new\nWeimar republic, they believed that the blame shouldn\u2019t solely be on Germany. The people of\nGermany believe that the \u2018November criminals\u2019 signed the \u2018diktat\u2019 and it was their fault\nhowever, they did not understand that the government did not have a choice and have to sign\nthe armistice or war would have continued.\nThe Germans also hated the reparations and restrictions from the military. Firstly the\nGermans were made to pay \u00a36.6 billion in reparations to pay for the damage of the war.\nGermany was already struggling at the time (and people were homeless and dying of\nstarvation of starvation. These reparations mostly effected the people who were not to blame\nfor the war. Also the military, which used to be a proud part of Germany was restricted to\n100,000 men, 6 battleships, 15,000 sailors in the navy, no airforce and no submarines. This\ngave Britain naval supremacy which was humiliating for the Germans and only gave them\nenough army to defend themselves.\nWhat the Germans did not understand is that the treaty could have been much harsher, but\nthe humiliation of the war guilt was probably the main factor because it hit the German\npeople hard and made them outcasts to the rest of Europe and the fact that they were not\nallowed to join the League of Nations probably made it worse for them. The Treaty of\nVersailles should have been about the Government and the military leaders but instead it hit\nthe ordinary people the most.\n\nResponse:\nThe student clearly shows developed explanation of the stated factor in the first paragraph and then two other factors. Each paragraph contains a range of \u2018factual knowledge\u2019 and \u2018developed reasoning\u2019 as the student explains why each factor would make the Germans hate the Treaty of Versailles. This puts the answer securely into level 3.\nLevel 4 requires \u2018complex explanation\u2019, a \u2018logical structure\u2019 and \u2018sustained line of reasoning\u2019 to form a \u2018sustained judgement\u2019. The conclusion is not a repetition of earlier points, it attempts to draw them together and consider the overall impact on the Germans and the injustice of the people being punished when the leaders were to blame. The theme of humiliation is sustained throughout \u2018Germany felt stripped of its power\u2019, \u2018This made the German population feel humiliated\u2019 \u2018These reparations mostly affected the people who were not to blame for the war\u2019, \u2018which was humiliating for the Germans\u2019. It is this sustained judgement and the recognition of the difference between the leaders and the people which puts this answer into level 4. The structure is clear and coherent but lacks some complexity and comparisons between different factors throughout, so wouldn\u2019t reach the top of the level. Overall, this falls into level 4 and should be awarded 14 marks.\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nMark Scheme:\n{mark_scheme}\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nAnswer:\n{answer}\n\nResponse:",
