## Context:

## Answer:
The League’s main aim was to promote peace and they contributed to peace in the 1920s. For
example, the Aaland Islands in 1921 was resolved by the League. Finland and Sweden both
wanted the territory however the league managed to get both countries to agree to the land
being given to Finland if they did not build forts. This showed other countries that the league
was able to resolve situations about land peacefully, which helped the League’s reputation for
building world peace.

The League also set up a slavery commissions and a refugee commissions, which helped to
stop slavery in some countries in Africa. The Leagues actions also helped refugees, which was
a big step in contributing to peace

## Response:
The student moves quickly beyond level 1, by identifying relevant events, and level 2 by showing ‘simple analysis of causation / consequence’, as evidenced by the way they explain how the solving of the Aaland Islands dispute contributed to international peace. Level 3 looks for ‘developed analysis’ and ‘a range of accurate knowledge and understanding’. A range of knowledge is evident in the first paragraph in the student’s summary of the Aaland Islands dispute, and in the second paragraph where they briefly explain the role of the slavery commission and refugee commission. Developed analysis is demonstrated in paragraph 1 in the final sentence ‘this showed other countries that the League was able to resolve situations about land peacefully, which helped the League’s reputation for building world peace.’ This is clearly level 3 as it shows ‘how tension was reduced at one stage in the process.’

To reach level 4, the answer would need to display ‘complex analysis’, in particular, ‘complex sequencing and reasoning’, for example, showing change over time or the consequences of a range of different events. The second paragraph in response A is not fully developed – the student identifies the commissions as contributing to international peace, but doesn’t explain their impact fully. As only one point is fully developed, with another identified, the answer remains in level 3.

Overall, the answer falls in to level 3 and should be awarded 5 marks.

## Context:

## Answer:
The League’ of Nations contributed to keeping peace around the world throughout the 1920s.
The league was useful in stopping smaller countries and protecting their independence from
other smaller countries. One of the league successes was in 1921 with the Aaland island. This
was a dispute between Sweden and Finland as they both wanted to have this land. The league
had to make a decision on who it went too. They chose Finland and Sweden peacefully
accepted and agreed this, with no further arguments. This was positive from the league as it
showed that they did have some impact, especially on the less powerful ones. This then lead
to other solutions being solved, one being Upper Silesia in 1923. This was between Poland
and Germany as they both wanted this land. The league decided to split it into two giving
Germany the rural side and Poland the industrial side. This cause tension as Germans
wouldn’t make as much money on the land. To solve this the League suggested Poland give
Germany more off coal. This settled the tension, causing both countries to be peaceful.
Another time the league contributed keeping international peace was with Bulgaria in 1925.

This was when Greece had invaded Bulgaria in hope of taking over. Bulgaria pleaded to the
League to help. This meant that the League ordered Greece to leave Bulgaria at once and pull
their troops out. Greece obeyed and Bulgaria remained independent. The actions of the
league of Nations through the 1920s, set examples to other smaller countries that they had to
obey their order and keep peace throughout the world. The league contained big members
with lots of influential power over the smaller countries. The big ones being Britain, Italy and
France.

## Response:
The range of ‘accurate knowledge and understanding’ displayed by the student places this answer into level 3, as it is combined with a clear focus on the issue of the question – how the League contributed to international peace. This developed analysis is demonstrated with phrases such as ‘this was positive from the League as it showed that they did have some impact’, ‘This then lead to other solutions..’ ‘The actions of the League of Nations through the 1920s, set examples to other smaller countries’.

To reach level 4, the answer would need to display ‘complex analysis’, and this is shown as the student explains the consequences of a range of different events, in chronological order, so showing ‘complex sequencing’ and showing ‘complex understanding’ of how the power of the League worked in the 1920s – it was larger, more powerful countries, such as Britain and France, who were able to enforce their will on less powerful countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Sweden. The emphasis on how this worked on smaller countries implies a reason why the League failed in the 1930s, when faced with challenges from its more powerful members. There is no need for the student to go into this as the question’s range is the 1920s, but their understanding is clear. Overall, this answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 8 marks.
