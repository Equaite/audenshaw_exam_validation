Your task is to grade exam questions according to a given mark scheme. \n    You will be given a Question, Answer, Context and a Mark Scheme to grade the Answer.\n\n    Follow these detailed instructions:\n\n    1. **Understand the Levels and Descriptors:**\n    - Review the mark scheme to understand the different levels and their descriptors. Each level descriptor represents the average performance expected for that level.\n\n    2. **Annotate the Answer:**\n    - Read through the student\u2019s answer and annotate it based on the qualities outlined in the mark scheme. Highlight the key points that align with the descriptors.\n\n    3. **Determine a Level:**\n    - Start at the lowest level of the mark scheme and check if the answer meets the criteria for that level.\n    - If it does, move to the next level and repeat until you find the highest level the answer meets.\n    - Consider the overall quality of the answer, rather than focusing on minor errors.\n    - Use a best-fit approach if the answer includes elements from multiple levels, placing it in the level that best matches the predominant quality.\n\n    4. **Determine a Mark:**\n    - Once a level is assigned, decide on the specific mark within that level.\n    - Compare the student\u2019s answer to exemplar materials provided during standardization, which include answers with assigned marks by the Lead Examiner.\n    - Use these comparisons to judge if the student's answer is of the same, better, or worse standard than the example, and assign a mark accordingly.\n\n    5. **Use Indicative Content as a Guide:**\n    - The indicative content in the mark scheme is a guide and not exhaustive. Credit valid points made by the student even if they are not listed in the indicative content.\n    - Students do not need to cover all points in the indicative content to achieve the highest level.\n\n    6. **Award No Marks for Irrelevant Answers:**\n    - If an answer contains nothing relevant to the question, award zero marks.\n\n    7. **Review as Necessary:**\n    - Re-read the student\u2019s answer as needed to ensure the level and mark are appropriate and accurately reflect the answer\u2019s quality.\n\n    By following these steps, you can accurately grade student answers according to the mark scheme, ensuring consistency and fairness in the evaluation process. \n\n    Provide a thorough step-by-step explanation of your reasoning. \n    Below are some examples of how to grade student answers:\n    \n\nQuestion:\nWrite an account of how the League of Nations contributed to international peace in the 1920s.\n\nMark Scheme:\nLevel_4:\n  description: \n    - Complex analysis of causation/consequence\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 8\n    minimum: 7\n  criteria:\n    - Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question\n  progression: \n    - Extends Level 3.\n    - Students may progress from a developed narrative of causation/consequence with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding which might be related, for example, to an analysis of how/why tension changed at different stages and/or showing understanding about how much each part of the sequence reduced tension.\n  example_answers: \n    - The contribution to international peace by the League sometimes depended on the status of the country they were defending.

For\nexample, the Aaland Islands in 1921 was resolved by the League. Finland and Sweden both\nwanted the territory however the league managed to get both countries to agree to the land\nbeing given to Finland if they did not build forts. This showed other countries that the league\nwas able to resolve situations about land peacefully, which helped the League\u2019s reputation for\nbuilding world peace.\n\nThe League also set up a slavery commissions and a refugee commissions, which helped to\nstop slavery in some countries in Africa. The Leagues actions also helped refugees, which was\na big step in contributing to peace\n\nResponse:\nThe student moves quickly beyond level 1, by identifying relevant events, and level 2 by showing \u2018simple analysis of causation / consequence\u2019, as evidenced by the way they explain how the solving of the Aaland Islands dispute contributed to international peace. Level 3 looks for \u2018developed analysis\u2019 and \u2018a range of accurate knowledge and understanding\u2019. A range of knowledge is evident in the first paragraph in the student\u2019s summary of the Aaland Islands dispute, and in the second paragraph where they briefly explain the role of the slavery commission and refugee commission. Developed analysis is demonstrated in paragraph 1 in the final sentence \u2018this showed other countries that the League was able to resolve situations about land peacefully, which helped the League\u2019s reputation for building world peace.\u2019 This is clearly level 3 as it shows \u2018how tension was reduced at one stage in the process.\u2019\n\nTo reach level 4, the answer would need to display \u2018complex analysis\u2019, in particular, \u2018complex sequencing and reasoning\u2019, for example, showing change over time or the consequences of a range of different events. The second paragraph in response A is not fully developed \u2013 the student identifies the commissions as contributing to international peace, but doesn\u2019t explain their impact fully. As only one point is fully developed, with another identified, the answer remains in level 3.\n\nOverall, the answer falls in to level 3 and should be awarded 5 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nWrite an account of how the League of Nations contributed to international peace in the 1920s.\n\nMark Scheme:\nLevel_4:\n  description: \n    - Complex analysis of causation/consequence\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 8\n    minimum: 7\n  criteria:\n    - Answer is presented in a coherent narrative/account that demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question\n  progression: \n    - Extends Level 3.\n    - Students may progress from a developed narrative of causation/consequence with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding which might be related, for example, to an analysis of how/why tension changed at different stages and/or showing understanding about how much each part of the sequence reduced tension.\n  example_answers: \n    - The contribution to international peace by the League sometimes depended on the status of the country they were defending.

One of the league successes was in 1921 with the Aaland island. This\nwas a dispute between Sweden and Finland as they both wanted to have this land. The league\nhad to make a decision on who it went too. They chose Finland and Sweden peacefully\naccepted and agreed this, with no further arguments. This was positive from the league as it\nshowed that they did have some impact, especially on the less powerful ones. This then lead\nto other solutions being solved, one being Upper Silesia in 1923. This was between Poland\nand Germany as they both wanted this land. The league decided to split it into two giving\nGermany the rural side and Poland the industrial side. This cause tension as Germans\nwouldn\u2019t make as much money on the land. To solve this the League suggested Poland give\nGermany more off coal. This settled the tension, causing both countries to be peaceful.\nAnother time the league contributed keeping international peace was with Bulgaria in 1925.\n\nThis was when Greece had invaded Bulgaria in hope of taking over. Bulgaria pleaded to the\nLeague to help. This meant that the League ordered Greece to leave Bulgaria at once and pull\ntheir troops out. Greece obeyed and Bulgaria remained independent. The actions of the\nleague of Nations through the 1920s, set examples to other smaller countries that they had to\nobey their order and keep peace throughout the world. The league contained big members\nwith lots of influential power over the smaller countries. The big ones being Britain, Italy and\nFrance.\n\nResponse:\nThe range of \u2018accurate knowledge and understanding\u2019 displayed by the student places this answer into level 3, as it is combined with a clear focus on the issue of the question \u2013 how the League contributed to international peace. This developed analysis is demonstrated with phrases such as \u2018this was positive from the League as it showed that they did have some impact\u2019, \u2018This then lead to other solutions..\u2019 \u2018The actions of the League of Nations through the 1920s, set examples to other smaller countries\u2019.\n\nTo reach level 4, the answer would need to display \u2018complex analysis\u2019, and this is shown as the student explains the consequences of a range of different events, in chronological order, so showing \u2018complex sequencing\u2019 and showing \u2018complex understanding\u2019 of how the power of the League worked in the 1920s \u2013 it was larger, more powerful countries, such as Britain and France, who were able to enforce their will on less powerful countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Sweden. The emphasis on how this worked on smaller countries implies a reason why the League failed in the 1930s, when faced with challenges from its more powerful members. There is no need for the student to go into this as the question\u2019s range is the 1920s, but their understanding is clear. Overall, this answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 8 marks.\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nMark Scheme:\n{mark_scheme}\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nAnswer:\n{answer}\n\nResponse:\n",
