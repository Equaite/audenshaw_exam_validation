        "Answer": "The League\u2019s main aim was to promote peace and they contributed to peace in the 1920s. For\nexample, the Aaland Islands in 1921 was resolved by the League. Finland and Sweden both\nwanted the territory however the league managed to get both countries to agree to the land\nbeing given to Finland if they did not build forts. This showed other countries that the league\nwas able to resolve situations about land peacefully, which helped the League\u2019s reputation for\nbuilding world peace.\n\nThe League also set up a slavery commissions and a refugee commissions, which helped to\nstop slavery in some countries in Africa. The Leagues actions also helped refugees, which was\na big step in contributing to peace",
        "Response": "The student moves quickly beyond level 1, by identifying relevant events, and level 2 by showing \u2018simple analysis of causation / consequence\u2019, as evidenced by the way they explain how the solving of the Aaland Islands dispute contributed to international peace. Level 3 looks for \u2018developed analysis\u2019 and \u2018a range of accurate knowledge and understanding\u2019. A range of knowledge is evident in the first paragraph in the student\u2019s summary of the Aaland Islands dispute, and in the second paragraph where they briefly explain the role of the slavery commission and refugee commission. Developed analysis is demonstrated in paragraph 1 in the final sentence \u2018this showed other countries that the League was able to resolve situations about land peacefully, which helped the League\u2019s reputation for building world peace.\u2019 This is clearly level 3 as it shows \u2018how tension was reduced at one stage in the process.\u2019\n\nTo reach level 4, the answer would need to display \u2018complex analysis\u2019, in particular, \u2018complex sequencing and reasoning\u2019, for example, showing change over time or the consequences of a range of different events. The second paragraph in response A is not fully developed \u2013 the student identifies the commissions as contributing to international peace, but doesn\u2019t explain their impact fully. As only one point is fully developed, with another identified, the answer remains in level 3.\n\nOverall, the answer falls in to level 3 and should be awarded 5 marks."

        "Answer": "The League\u2019 of Nations contributed to keeping peace around the world throughout the 1920s.\nThe league was useful in stopping smaller countries and protecting their independence from\nother smaller countries. One of the league successes was in 1921 with the Aaland island. This\nwas a dispute between Sweden and Finland as they both wanted to have this land. The league\nhad to make a decision on who it went too. They chose Finland and Sweden peacefully\naccepted and agreed this, with no further arguments. This was positive from the league as it\nshowed that they did have some impact, especially on the less powerful ones. This then lead\nto other solutions being solved, one being Upper Silesia in 1923. This was between Poland\nand Germany as they both wanted this land. The league decided to split it into two giving\nGermany the rural side and Poland the industrial side. This cause tension as Germans\nwouldn\u2019t make as much money on the land. To solve this the League suggested Poland give\nGermany more off coal. This settled the tension, causing both countries to be peaceful.\nAnother time the league contributed keeping international peace was with Bulgaria in 1925.\n\nThis was when Greece had invaded Bulgaria in hope of taking over. Bulgaria pleaded to the\nLeague to help. This meant that the League ordered Greece to leave Bulgaria at once and pull\ntheir troops out. Greece obeyed and Bulgaria remained independent. The actions of the\nleague of Nations through the 1920s, set examples to other smaller countries that they had to\nobey their order and keep peace throughout the world. The league contained big members\nwith lots of influential power over the smaller countries. The big ones being Britain, Italy and\nFrance.",
        "Response": "The range of \u2018accurate knowledge and understanding\u2019 displayed by the student places this answer into level 3, as it is combined with a clear focus on the issue of the question \u2013 how the League contributed to international peace. This developed analysis is demonstrated with phrases such as \u2018this was positive from the League as it showed that they did have some impact\u2019, \u2018This then lead to other solutions..\u2019 \u2018The actions of the League of Nations through the 1920s, set examples to other smaller countries\u2019.\n\nTo reach level 4, the answer would need to display \u2018complex analysis\u2019, and this is shown as the student explains the consequences of a range of different events, in chronological order, so showing \u2018complex sequencing\u2019 and showing \u2018complex understanding\u2019 of how the power of the League worked in the 1920s \u2013 it was larger, more powerful countries, such as Britain and France, who were able to enforce their will on less powerful countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Sweden. The emphasis on how this worked on smaller countries implies a reason why the League failed in the 1930s, when faced with challenges from its more powerful members. There is no need for the student to go into this as the question\u2019s range is the 1920s, but their understanding is clear. Overall, this answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 8 marks."

        "Answer": "In 1955 the new soviet leader Krushchev wanted to change the ideas of communism, so he introduced the policy of destallination. He aimed to decrease military spending and get rid of Stalin\u2019s vicious and violent ideologies.\nHowever, Hungary saw this as an opportunity to have a revolution. A large amount of Hungarians hated the Soviet military and how much control they had in their lives. A large group of students protested to decrease censorship of the media and demanded that soviet troops be moved out of Hungary. The Hungarian leader Imre Nagy, decreased censorship and Krushev agreed to move troops out of Hungary.\nNot long later, Imre Nagy did a speech saying that Hungary was going to leave the Warsaw Pact. Khrushchev was not happy because if Hungary left, the buffer zone created earlier in the cold war would start to wear away.\nIn response to this Krushchev brought troops back into Hungary with tanks and diminished any protestors within 2 weeks. Hungarian soldiers joined in with the protests so many Hungarian soldiers were also killed. The severely effected the Cold War.",
        "Response": "This student shows good knowledge of events in Hungary and writes a narrative description. This moves it beyond level 1, where only \u2018general statements\u2019 and \u2018basic knowledge\u2019 is required. This answer is presented in a \u2018structured account\u2019, with events in chronological order, leading to a simple analysis of causation / consequence, placing it in level 2. \nTo reach level 3, there would need to be a greater focus on the issue of the question, how those events \u2018affected the Cold War\u2019. There is only the briefest mention of this at the end of the answer. A level 3 \u2018developed analysis\u2019 would need to develop each stage of the narrative to link to the consequence of that on the Cold War.\nOverall, this answer falls into level 2, and should be awarded 4 marks."

        "Answer": "When Khrushchev implemented his policy of destalinisation in Hungary he removed loyal Stalinist Rakosi from power giving into the pressures of student protests on 23rd October 1956. Rakosi was replaced with Imre Nagy who began introducing reforms and freeing Catholic Cardinals from prison. This change in Hungary affected the Cold War since it showed that Khrushchev really was aiming for peaceful co-existence and could be seen as a step towards a truce. However on 7th Nov 1956, Nagy announced that Hungary would be leaving the Warsaw Pact, this was too far for Khrushchev, who three days later sent 1,000 soviet tanks into Budapest, killing 3000 Hungarians and causing 20,000 to flee the country. This affected the Cold War since it showed the west that the soviets and their share of influence operated an oppressive regime and reminded the west why there was tensions between them, keeping tensions high.",
        "Response": "This student moves beyond the \u2018simple analysis\u2019 of level 2, by providing detailed \u2018accurate knowledge\u2019, for example the name of \u2018loyal Stalinist Rakosi\u2019 and key dates \u201823rd October 1956\u2019 and \u20187th November 1956\u2019. For each point that is made, the student then explains the impact of that on the Cold War. This is done explicitly: \u2018This change in Hungary affected the Cold War since it showed\u2026\u2019; \u2018This affected the Cold War since it showed the west that\u2026\u2019 \u2018keeping tensions high\u2019. It is this focus on the question and level of accurate knowledge that places this answer into level 3, even though the answer is a little on the short side.\nIn order to achieve level 4, the student would need to develop both points more fully. The first point in particular could be developed further. To say that \u2018Khrushchev really was aiming for peaceful co-existence\u2019 is simplistic and ignores what follows. A more complex analysis would show complex sequencing and reasoning and link the different stages of the events, explaining how tension increased or decreased at each stage. \nOverall, the answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 5 marks."

        "Answer": "A way in which events in Hungary affected the cold war is that it demonstrated the importance of the USSR\u2019s sphere of influence. In 1956 with Maytas Rakosi becoming an increasingly unpopular leader amongst the Hungarian people due to his suggestion of freedom, Khruschev replaced him with Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151, who was no more popular and created widespread student uprising on October 1956. As such, popular Hungarian communist Imre Nagy became leader of the nation and began to initiate reforms such as freedom of speech, free elections and private land ownership. However, when Nagy attempted to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, a military pact securing the soviet sphere of influence, the USSR reacted strongly, sending troops back into Hungary, overthrowing Nagy to replace him with a Soviet puppet. This demonstrated that the USSR was strongly committed to maintaining its sphere of influence to protect it from the west and were willing to use any means necessary.\nAnother way the Hungarian uprising affected the cold war is through demonstrations showing the lack of interest the USA had in direct conflict with the USSR. In looking to institute a more liberal form of communism with greater freedoms and dealign from the USSR, by leaving the Warsaw Pact, Hungarian leader Nagy expected support from the USA and Eisenhower, given America\u2019s moral commitment to promoting freedom around the world. However, partly due to the distraction that was the Suez crisis and partly due to the risk of engaging in conflict with the USSR, the USA provided no support, either economic, political or military and allowed the USSR to regain full control of Hungary and kill 30,000 Hungarians in the protests. Therefore, the events in Hungary in 1956 demonstrated to the world that both major powers respected each others sphere of influences and did not want to engage within each other because of the risk of brutal direct conflict.",
        "Response": "This student demonstrates complex analysis and signposts this from the start of each paragraph by making a complex point. \u2018it demonstrated the importance of the USSR\u2019s sphere of influence\u2019 and \u2018the lack of interest the USA had in direct conflict with the USSR\u2019 shows complex understanding of the underlying issues in Hungary and the Cold War at this time, moving beyond a simple analysis of the events.\nThis complex start is then backed up with a range of detailed accurate knowledge in both paragraphs, detailing names, events and dates confidently, before explaining what this showed at the end of each paragraph. In paragraph 2, the candidate shows a good awareness of the wider context, for example, with the \u2018distraction of the Suez crisis\u2019 and how this impacted the events in Hungary. The overall effect is of a \u2018coherent narrative\u2019 which clearly shows good understanding of the issues surrounding Hungary and is able to explain them in good detail.\nOverall, the answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 8 marks."

        "Answer": "The end of the war in Vietnam left to problems for many different reasons. One of these problems was that many US soldiers had impregnated Vietnamese women which meant that a lot of children didn\u2019t know who their fathers were and this left many Vietnamese women with the role of raising a child by themselves\nAnother problem was that there was still many traps and bombs left over from the war which was dangerous for civilians. Also, many of the villages in Vietnam, had been destroyed by bombs which left Vietnamese civilians with no houses and having to resort to caves for shelter. Another problem was that the UN was seen by people as a \u2018puppet\u2019 of the USA and the people lost respect for it. Furthermore, the American people were disgusted and shocked by their soldiers actions and there was distrust in the American Government\nAnother problem was that Black Americans were extremely upset with how they were unfairly drafted and how they were fighting a war for Americans when America didn\u2019t even give them any rights which made them angry at this unjust treatment and led to more hate and distrust in the American Government.",
        "Response": "The student identifies four different problems caused by the end of the Vietnam War \u2013 the fatherless children, the remaining traps and bombs, the loss of respect for the UN and the treatment of Black Americans. Each of these are briefly expanded with some specific knowledge and understanding and there is good focus on the question. This answer clearly fulfils level 2 and comes close to level 3. However, there is not quite the \u2018range of accurate knowledge\u2019 or detail required for level 3 or the \u2018sequencing and reasoning\u2019 to develop the analysis. To reach level 3, it would have been better for the student to focus on explaining two problems in greater detail rather than four briefly. \nOverall, the answer falls into level 2, and should be awarded 4 marks."

        "Answer": "The end of the war led to problems in Vietnam due to the war tactics the UN used. In the Vietnam War the UN used chemical warfare using napalm, agent blue, and agent orange. Agent blue and agent orange were designed to kill of vegetation and the UN forces targeted the VC food source which was ric. This would kill the VC\u2019s food supply. However this had a lasting effect on the Vietnamese population as the chemicals digested later caused deformities in new born babies. This causes problems in Vietnam as it means these children\u2019s need medical attention.\nFurthermore , we can see the end of the Vietnam leading to problems as the Vietnamese land had been destroyed through Americans (UN) Rolling Thunder operation where they carpet bombed towns in Vietnam to ruin their infrastructures. This meant after the war Vietnamese people were left with nothing and had to rebuild themselves in both north and south Vietnam and they no longer had the support of America.",
        "Response": "The student identifies a problem in the first sentence \u2018the war tactics the UN used.\u2019 They then develop this with specific factual knowledge and understanding of the consequences of the chemical weapons used. A range of knowledge is shown, with different consequences explained. There is an explicit link to the issue in the final sentence, completing the developed analysis of this point.\nThe second paragraph is shorter, but still shows specific factual knowledge and understanding of a different aspect of the war and the problems it left. \u2018This meant after the war the Vietnamese people were left with nothing\u2026\u2019.\nThe developed analysis of two different consequences of the war means that overall, this answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 6 marks."

        "Answer": "In 1973, when the last set of US troops left Vietnam, America believed that the war was over and they had successfully contained communism. However, in the short term, only after a few years, the south fell under communism. The immediate long term consequences for the USA was a declining reputation as they were defeated by the communists who had a disadvantage in technology such as airpower. Furthermore, when LBJ became president of the USA, he promised to \u2018build a better society\u2019 but by then end of the Vietnam War $137 billion was spent on the war and barely any money was spent on the country which makes the public question the government\u2019s promises.\nAlso, after the Vietnam war, chemical weapons, such as napalm and agent orange had severely damaged Vietnam causing cancer and birth deformities as well as the inability of growing crops. Consequently, many people starved to death and some even fled their country as refugees to seek safety as their country is horrifically devastated. This meant that Vietnam was damaged not only socially but also environmentally and economically.\nIn conclusion, at the ned of the Vietnam War, there were numerous negative consequences such as the Americans loosing it\u2019s reputation and millions of Vietnamese refugees fleeing their countries.",
        "Response": "The student demonstrates a range of specific factual knowledge and understanding by considering the problems for both the USA, in the first paragraph, and then Vietnam in the second paragraph. This demonstrates complex analysis, considering the impact on different groups of people and at different times, \u2018in the short term\u2019 and \u2018the immediate long term consequences\u2019. They also show complexity by highlighting the social, environmental and economic consequences for Vietnam. \nSpecific factual knowledge is shown by the date at the start, the economic cost of the war for the USA and the names of the chemical weapons used. The conclusion is not required as it just repeats earlier points.\nOverall, this answer falls into level 4 and should be given 8 marks."

        "Answer": "During the Iran-Iraq War in 1980-88, Saddam Hussein committed many acts of cruel atrocities on the Kurdish and Shia civilians who were innocent. Saddam would frequent bomb and shell Kurds and also drop chemical bombs and biological weapons such as gas to kill the Kurdish and Shia people. This of cause disgusted many countries in the gulf, especially Iran who had a large Shia population, but other countries as well who deemed Saddam\u2019s actions unacceptable. This led to the uprising and protests in many countries in the gulf, and Iraq and Saddam were viewed as a rogue nation.\nAfter the Iran-Iraq War and gulf war, no fly zones were implemented over Iraq to try and prevent bombing of Kurds. However this didn\u2019t stop Saddam from forcing and isolating the Kurdish people and forcing them to flee their homes to find shelter. Where Iranian forced would attempt to kill the groups fleeing, before the could escape. This created unrest across the Arab world as Muslims were being slaughtered mercilessly, therefore many countries had an agenda against Iraq\u2019s government and Saddam and unrest in Iraq also became greater because Saddam\u2019s popularity decreased. Furthermore leading to Saddam and his government becoming more hostile to any opposers.",
        "Response": "The student clearly structures their answer to analyse cause and consequence. The first paragraph talks about during the Iran-Iraq War and develops their paragraph with specific factual knowledge and understanding. There is a clear link to the issue in the question of \u2018problems in the Gulf\u2019, with \u2018This led to the uprisings and protests in many countries\u2026\u2019\nThe second paragraph gives another example, from after the Iran-Iraq War.

The depth of the factual knowledge could also be developed further with specific details to achieve level 4.\nOverall, the answer falls in level 3 and should be awarded 6 marks."

        "Answer": "After the 1990 Gulf War and the liberation of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein was left in power as the US and UN believed that the Kurds and Shias would incite an uprising in Iraq and overthrow Saddam. America did not want to be involved in Iraq internal affairs so removed most of their troops. Many uprisings happened throughout 1991 and 1992 but they were all violently suppressed by Saddam\u2019s regime. Saddam used biological and chemical weapons to bomb Kurdish villages and he diverted waterways away from Shia marshes which lead to famine and malnutrition. A UN resolution provided a \u2018safe heaven\u2019 for Kurds but there were still 1.4 million refugees.\nThere were still economic and trade sanctions placed on Iraq and the US set up an oil-for-food policy where if Iraq let America control their oil production they would be able to get food. Although, Saddam never let the food aid given by the UN get to the Kurds and the Shias which left millions of Iraqi civilians dying of starvation and with sever malnutrition. Other counties in the Gulf saw the treatment of the Kurds and Shias through WMD\u2019s. This led to a UN weapons inspector to be ordered to be let into the country. This led to all Saddam\u2019s chemical and biological weapons to be confiscated. They also had to let a weapons inspector come into the country which Saddam did not like and protested against. The UN made Saddam allow the weapons inspector in and he found a small amount of chemical ammunition but did not find any WMD\u2019s.\nThis was ignored by the US and UK which then led to the 2nd Gulf War. Saddam Hussein\u2019s treatment of the Kurds and Shia Muslims in Iraq was one of the major prefaces for the invasion of Iraq.",
        "Response": "The answer clearly analyses cause and consequence throughout, even though the question is not directly addressed. The \u2018problems in the Gulf\u2019 are identified, such as \u2018many uprisings happened\u2019, \u2018which lead to famine and malnutrition\u2019, \u2018there were still 1.4 million refugees\u2019, \u2018other countries in the Gulf saw the treatment of the Kurds and Shias\u2019. There is a range of accurate and detailed knowledge throughout and the \u2018complex sequencing and reasoning\u2019 is demonstrated by the clear chronological order and the way the answer shows how one thing led to another, from the end of the Gulf War to the invasion of Iraq.\nOverall, the answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 7 marks."
