## Context:
Source A: A painting entitled 'The Harvest of Battle', by the British artist, CWR Nevinson, 1919. It was painted as part of a record for the First World War. Nevinson based his painting on sketches made during a visit to the Western Front in 1917.

## Answer:
Because it shows that Japan is walking over the league of nations and entering League of
Nations Headquarters. It shows that Japan is in charge because the person behind the door
bowing to him and has got flower in his hand.

## Response:
Response A demonstrates ‘simple analysis’ with a description of what is shown in the source. It does not demonstrate the developed analysis, showing factual knowledge and understanding, as there is no additional knowledge shown and the student does not explain how that image is critical of the League of Nations. It identifies two relevant features of the source and so would be given 2 marks. Overall, this answer falls into level 1 and should be awarded 2 marks.

## Answer:
We know this as the cartoon was published in 1933. This was after the Manchurian Crisis
which was detrimental to the league, showing it had no real power as it could not stop Japan
from invading Manchuria. When they did invade, all the league could do was tell them off but
Japan simply ignored them.
In the image Japan is depicted as walking over the league. This is in reference to the fact that
Japan completely ignored them and did whatever they wanted to. This was Japan undermining
the league of nations and showing how it can be completely ignored and walked all over. We
know this as the league had no army to force Japan to stop.

## Response:
Response B shows some ‘developed analysis’ evidenced by their inclusion of factual knowledge and understanding. This is shown in the first paragraph where the student identifies the date it was made then says why that was significant, showing some knowledge: “This was after the Manchurian Crisis which was detrimental to the league, showing it had no real power as it could not stop Japan from invading Manchuria. When they did invade, all the league could do was tell them off but Japan simply ignored them.”
In the second paragraph, the student picks out a detail from the content of the source (Japan walking over the League) and then shows understanding by explaining how that is critical, and adding the factual knowledge, that the League had no army of its own.
Overall, this answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 4 marks.

    - They may evaluate the relationship between the sources based on analysis of provenance and contextual knowledge.
  example_answers:
    - The sources are useful to show how difficult it was for the governments of the time to respond to the threats posed by Hitler. The Munich Agreement mentioned in Source B was the work of several countries, not just Britain alone, therefore the responsibility for giving in to his demands is a shared one. The American view in Source C is useful to show that even countries outside Europe were concerned with the issue of Czechoslovakia and the policy of appeasement.

  progression:

  example_answers:
    - Source B is useful for showing a positive view of appeasement as Chamberlain presented it to the people of Britain. The Munich Agreement allowed Hitler to occupy the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia despite it not being German land. However, in return for this concession, Chamberlain secured the Anglo-German declaration which was a promise that war would be avoided.
    - Source C is critical of Chamberlain for thinking that Hitler will be content with the concessions. The Munich Agreement had allowed Hitler to take over land in Czechoslovakia. Hitler had promised not to make any further demands for more territory but many people at the time thought he would try and take more land.
    - Source C is useful because it shows an opinion from outside Europe that was critical of Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement. The cartoon reflects the view that by giving into Hitler the Munich Agreement would encourage his territorial ambitions even further. This prediction came true when Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939. Source B shows why, in the short term, appeasement seemed to have worked. Chamberlain wanted to use discussion to avoid war with Hitler and Source B was seen as evidence that he had achieved his aim.

## Context:
Source B: Adapted from a statement issued by Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler
following the signing of the Munich Agreement, in September 1938.

"We, the German Chancellor and British Prime Minister, have met again and
agreed that the relationship between our countries is most important both for
ourselves and Europe. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 and the
successful Munich conference show our countries’ desire to avoid war between
us. We are determined that talking shall be the way of solving any issues
concerning our two countries."

Source C: A cartoon published in a widely read and respected American newspaper,
7 October 1938.

## Answer:
Source B is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement. In the source it says ‘The
Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935’ and ‘desire to avoid war’ from my contextual
knowledge I know that Britian signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement with Germany
stating that Germany can have a navy half the size of Britain’s- This was banned in the Treaty
of Versailles but Britain did it to avoid war, this is the policy of appeasement. The nature of
this source is a statement from Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler in 1938. This means that
this source is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement as it shows the policy in
action.
Source C is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement. In the source it says
‘HE’LL BE QUIET NOW MAYBE’. This shows a figure named Chamberlain saying this. I can also
see a baby sleeping with a bottle name ‘Munich agreement’ this baby also has a Swastika on
it’s cot. From my contextual knowledge I know that Britain gave Hitler what he wanted in the
Munich agreement to avoid war. The nature of this source is a cartoon published in October
1938. It’s origin is a American newspaper. The purpose of this source is to mock Neville
Chamberlain, as many Americans thought he was weak for giving Hitler so many concessions
at the Munich conference. 

## Response:
The candidate describes (or analyses, in the words of the mark scheme) both sources – saying what they can see and what the sources show about appeasement. This is what is needed for level 1.
For level 2, the candidate needs to offer simple evaluation based on content and/or provenance. This involves bringing in some contextual or own knowledge. In source B the student has done this, though the knowledge isn’t detailed (for example, the point about the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles could be developed further) or entirely accurate (for example the agreement allowed Germany 35% of Britain’s navy, not half). However, there is enough for level 2. The student has addressed both the content of the source and the provenance briefly (talking about the nature of the source and evaluating this in a simple way). The lack of detailed knowledge holds this answer in level 2 and it lacks the ‘extended reasoning’ required for level 3.
For source C, the student has again provided some simple evaluation of the source, again the knowledge shown isn’t particularly detailed. However, the evaluation of the provenance is stronger here, showing some extended reasoning, evidenced by the point about American attitudes and why the source was made – therefore making it useful to show attitudes to appeasement. It is the slightly better developed point at the end of the second paragraph that pushes the answer into level 3. Overall, the answer falls into a low level 3 and should be awarded 7 marks.

Source C: A cartoon published in a widely read and respected American newspaper,

## Answer:
Source B is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement as it reveals the Prime
minister, Chamberlain, and Hitler’s intentions behind signing it. The source state the policy
shows “our countries” desire to avoid war”, we know this to be true as the munich Agreement
allowed Hitler to reclaim the Sudetenland in return for no further invasions which could’ve
lead to war. This is also useful in revealing public opinions – British and German citizens did
not want war following the horrors and deaths of the first World War. Chamberlain claims he
achieved ‘peace in our time’ through his policy of appeasement and the source supports the
notion that he believed Germany would retain peace. The provenance of the source reveals
that if is an adaptation of the statement issued by Chamberlain and Hitler; this first hand
account gives validity to it’s content in expressing the truce claims behind the of
appeasement.
Source C is useful to historians studying the policy of appeasement as it reveals attitudes of
opposition towards it the source depicts Hitler as a baby, suggestion he is childish and erratic,
being pacified by a bottle labelled ‘the Munich Agreement’. This suggest Chamberlain’s policy
would only temporarily stop Hitler and that, when the bottle is empty he will continue to do as
he pleases. Historians know this to be true as following the proposed reclaiming of the
Sudetenland, Hitler would go on to invade Czechoslovakia. This broke the policy of
appeasement as Hitler had no claim over the land and took it forcefully. These ideas are
furthered by the text ‘Shh-hh! He’ll be quite now-maybe!’ suggesting to Historians that
Chamberlain know the policy would only be a temporary solution. The provenance reveals
this cartoon was published in an American newspaper. At the time America practiced
isolationism from European affairs, therefore the source is useful to historians as it reveals
unbiased public opinions, of the time about effectiveness of the policy of appeasement.

## Response:
This candidate shows developed evaluation and a good level of contextual knowledge – the student brings in a lot of knowledge about the events before and after the Munich Agreement – but also the student demonstrates ‘extended reasoning relating to utility’ as evidenced by the way that almost every point is brought back to an evaluation of the source, for example, “This is also useful in revealing public opinions”, “the source supports the notion that he believed Germany would retain peace” “this first hand account gives validity to its content”. Both sources are dealt with equally well, demonstrating the ‘complex evaluation of both sources with sustained judgement’ which is required for level 4. The relationship between the sources could be dealt with in a more explicit way, though it is implied where the student compares the attitude of Hitler and Chamberlain in source B with the opposition in source C. To reach the top of the level, the student could have also included more specific factual detail, such as dates or detail about the Four Powers Conference. Overall, the answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 11 marks.

## Context:
An American cartoon, published by a widely read newspaper in 1951, commenting on the Korean War. The words in the cartoon are spoken by Stalin, the leader of the USSR. Mao, the leader of China, is loading soldiers into the barrel of a gun. The newspaper cartoon, on the opposite page, shows a man, who is using a shovel to put small soldiers into a barrel of a large gun. The man has the name ‘MAO’ written on the bottom of one of his trouser legs and he is sweating. Behind him stands another man who is watching him while holding a pipe in his hand. The words “Always Glad To Lend My Neighbour A Shovel” are written at the top of the image.

## Answer:
Source A is critical of Stalin as it shows soldiers being loaded into ‘the barrel of the gun.’ This
demonstrates that the source believes that Stalin is responsible for the death of the soldiers
due to his violent actions and decisions during his time being the leader of the USSR leading
the source to present him in a critical way.
Another reason why source A is critical of Stalin is due to the fact that Stalin is standing there
with a smile on his face while Mao is doing all the work. This could represent the fact that
Stalin made others do all the hard work and suffer while he watched from the side

## Response:
The student identifies relevant features of the source, for example ‘it shows soldiers being loaded in to the barrel of the gun’ and ‘Stalin is standing there with a smile on his face’. The student then analyses these features and explains what they mean and how they could be seen as critical of Stalin. There is some ‘simple knowledge’ shown, when they mention ‘his violent actions and decisions’ but this is not developed with factual detail. Therefore, this answer is level 1. In order to get to level 2, the student would need to add detailed examples or factual knowledge and understanding to provide developed analysis. Overall, this answer falls into level 1 and would be awarded 2 marks.

The words “Always Glad To Lend My Neighbour A Shovel” are written at the top of the image.

## Answer:
Source A is critical of Stalin because it is exposing how he abused his alliance with China. Mao is shovelling his own troops into a barrel of a gun which represents how during the Korean war – a proxy war in which Stalin and the USSR fuelled – Stalin used Chinese troops rather than his own. This was a clear moment when the USSR took advantage of their new friendship with China, and it is depicted in the cartoon to expose how Stalin used China. Additionally it is a criticism of how in the Korean war it was mainly Koreans and Chinese soldiers who suffered. This is shown as Stalin is illustrated laughing at Mao, almost acting like a puppeteer.

## Response:
The student also identifies relevant features of the source: ‘Mao is shovelling his own troops into a barrel of a gun’; ‘Stalin is illustrated laughing at Mao’. They then develop this point with ‘factual knowledge and understanding’, ‘Stalin use Chinese troops rather than his own’. They also use the key term ‘proxy war’ and then focus back on the issue of the question ‘to expose how Stalin used China’. There is a second developed point, where the student shows knowledge of the Korean War ‘it was mainly Koreans and Chinese soldiers who suffered’ and then links this to the source ‘This is shown as…’. Overall, this answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 4 marks.

    - Source B is useful to show how Stalin tried to justify his actions by accusing the Western powers of acting unreasonably. He is trying to blame the Western powers for breaking the agreement made at the Yalta Conference in 1945, that Germany and Berlin would be kept as four separate sections. However, the Western Allies merged their zones in 1948 and also introduced a single currency into the newly formed West Germany and West Berlin.
    - Source C is a British cartoon so it will be opposed to Stalin’s blockade of West Berlin. The cartoon makes fun of ‘Joe’ Stalin because he cannot block the air corridors to stop planes from bringing supplies to Berlin.
    - Source C is useful to an historian because it shows that British people were pleased to be standing up to Stalin’s Blockade. The Allies began the Berlin Airlift which was a solution to the blockade of land routes to West Berlin. Planes were used to provide essential supplies of food and fuel to the people of West Berlin. The cartoon shows that Stalin wanted to try and stop the planes from flying. However, he did not want to risk shooting them down as that would be seen as an act of war. Source B explains that Stalin’s motive for the blockade was to protect his zone of occupation. When Britain, France and the USA merged their zones into one, Stalin was afraid that Germany would recover and could threaten the USSR once again.

We warned you many times to follow the agreements made by the Four Powers regarding Germany and Berlin. The Soviet Government has now been forced to take measures to protect the interests of the German people and the economy of the Soviet zone. We are concerned about the people of Berlin and are trying to solve the problems about essential supplies. If the situation continues we will not hesitate to supply the whole of Berlin by ourselves.
Source C: A cartoon published in a widely read British newspaper, September 1948. The three figures represent Joseph Stalin, and Soviet politicians. The title, ‘No Go Joe’, refers to Joseph Stalin. The cartoon, on the opposite page, shows three men standing on each other’s shoulders. Two men, one of them is Stalin, have signs around their necks that read, ‘RAIL CLOSED’ and ‘ROAD CLOSED’. The man at the top is holding a large net in his hand and planes can be seen flying overhead. One of the planes is caught in the net. Behind the men, there is a railway barrier and an arrow–shaped sign pointing into the distance towards where the planes are flying. The sign reads ‘BERLIN’. Under the image are the words ‘NO GO JOE!’

## Answer:
I think that source C would be useful to historians. I think this because it is an accurate representation of what happened. Firstly, this source is critical of Stalin because it is drawn and published by the British. On the cartoon, Stalin and the Soviet leaders are stood with ‘road closed’ and ‘rail closed’ on a sign around their necks, this is accurate because when Stalin introduced the blockade, he wanted to starve west Berlin of essential supplies so he blocked railway lines and roads. However, as the source shows, the person on top has no sign and the net he is holding is damaged, this effectively shows the lack of control of air transport. This is how the Berlin air lift started and helped the west Berliners get the essentials they needed.
I also think source B would also be useful to a historian because it is the Soviet government’s actual words that were sent to western governments. This is critical of the western superpowers. The Berlin blockade was caused be an introduction to the new West German currency called the deutchmark. All of the western superpowers joined up their parts of Berlin to help the economy recover faster. The USSR felt threatened by this so they increased the blockade.

## Response:
The student shows understanding of both sources, so achieves level 1. This is shown when the student says ‘it is drawn and published by the British’, ‘Stalin and Soviet leaders are stood with ‘road closed’ and ‘rail closed’ on a sign around their necks’. The student then starts to bring in some contextual knowledge and shows some ‘simple evaluation’: ‘This is accurate because when Stalin introduced the blockade, he wanted to starve west Berlin of essential supplies’. This would achieve level 2. The student does not provide the level of detail or ‘developed evaluation’ that is required for level 3. They would need to include more specific detail and a greater focus on the issue of usefulness, rather than the ‘accurate’ they use throughout the answer.
Similarly, source B demonstrates some simple evaluation, but not developed. There is some knowledge shown about the causes of the Berlin blockade and this is used to support the source ‘The USSR felt threatened by this so they increased the blockade’, which is level 2, simple evaluation. There is not enough detailed knowledge or ‘extended reasoning related to utility’ to reach level 3, even though the candidate does address both sources. Overall, this answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 5 marks.

    - Source B is useful to show how Stalin tried to justify his actions by accusing the Western powers of acting unreasonably. He is trying to blame the Western powers for breaking the agreement made at the Yalta Conference in 1945, that Germany and Berlin would be kept as four separate sections. However, the Western Allies merged their zones in 1948 and also introduced a single currency into the newly formed West Germany and West Berlin.
    - Source C is a British cartoon so it will be opposed to Stalin’s blockade of West Berlin. The cartoon makes fun of ‘Joe’ Stalin because he cannot block the air corridors to stop planes from bringing supplies to Berlin.
    - Source C is useful to an historian because it shows that British people were pleased to be standing up to Stalin’s Blockade. The Allies began the Berlin Airlift which was a solution to the blockade of land routes to West Berlin. Planes were used to provide essential supplies of food and fuel to the people of West Berlin. The cartoon shows that Stalin wanted to try and stop the planes from flying. However, he did not want to risk shooting them down as that would be seen as an act of war. Source B explains that Stalin’s motive for the blockade was to protect his zone of occupation. When Britain, France and the USA merged their zones into one, Stalin was afraid that Germany would recover and could threaten the USSR once again.

Behind the men, there is a railway barrier and an arrow–shaped sign pointing into the distance towards where the planes are flying. The sign reads ‘BERLIN’. Under the image are the words ‘NO GO JOE!’

## Answer:
Source B is useful to some extent because it mentions the agreement made by the Four Powers. This is referring to the Yalta & Potsdam Conferences where Britain, France, the USA & the USSR agreed to divide Germany into four zones. Since Berlin, the capital, lay in the Soviet zone, it would also be divided. Source B is useful because Britain, France & the USA combined their sectors of Germany to form Trizonia, set up a new government, the Bundestag, & introduced a new currency without consulting Stalin. Source B states that measures were taken to protect the economy of the soviet zone & it was written in 1948, the first year of the Berlin Blockade. A mini-blockade occurred at this time to stop the transfer of military supplies. It was written by the Soviet government, who may have been trying to defend their actions of setting up a blockade. Overall, Source B is useful because it indicates that disagreements over Berlin are what caused the blockade.
Source C is useful because it shows how road & rail links were cut off in the Berlin blockade. Also, energy from power stations in East Germany were cut off. As it was published for the British public it is showing the positives of the Berlin airlift. This occurred from 1948 to 1949 & a one-way system & an air corridor was implemented to prevent crashes, however 79 pilots did die. The planes in the source are seen to be flying from West Germany to West Berlin to counteract the blockade & supply materials. During the Easter Parade, 12,000 tonnes of coal was given to West Berlin. Source C is very convincing because it shows the Truman Doctrine in action through the airlift. Since Berlin was a capitalist city in a communist country, Truman was determined not to let it fall to Communism As it was written, in Britain, it portrays the Soviet politicians in a negative light, however it was because of the Berlin airlift that the blockade was called off in 1948.
Overall, Source C is the most useful because it presents the success of the airlift.

## Response:
The answer moves quickly into level 3, by providing ‘developed evaluation’ of both sources, showing ‘extended reasoning’ through detailed knowledge of events and clear understanding of the messages of the sources. In source B, there is an accurate description of how Germany was divided and the formation of Trizonia, which threatened the USSR, and this is linked successfully to the content of the source ‘source B states that measures were taken to protect the economy of the Soviet zone’ and ‘overall, Source B is useful because it indicates that disagreements over Berlin are what caused the blockade’. This final sentence of the paragraph shows good focus on the question and secures it into level 3. 
Similarly, source C is developed with knowledge about how the Blockade worked and the Berlin Airlift. The knowledge is detailed and linked to features of the source, so providing developed evaluation of the content. ‘road and rail links were cut off’, ‘The planes in the source are seen to be flying from West Germany to West Berlin’. Specific factual details such as ’12,000 tonnes of coal was given to West Berlin’, are a good indicator of a level 3 answer. There is also the reference to the key term ‘Truman Doctrine’ and understanding shown of this.
To get to level 4, the answer would need to evaluate the provenance as well as the content of the sources. There is some brief attempt in both sources; ‘It was written by the Soviet government, who may have been trying to defend their actions’ and ‘As it was written in Britain, it portrays the Soviet politicians in a negative light’, but these brief references are simple evaluation, not developed, so not enough to secure level 4, which requires ‘Complex evaluation of both sources… based on content and provenance’. 
Overall, there is developed evaluation of the content of both sources, so the answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 9 marks.

## Context:
Source B: Adapted from a letter sent by the Soviet Government to the governments of America, Britain, and France, July 1948. 
We warned you many times to follow the agreements made by the Four Powers regarding Germany and Berlin. The Soviet Government has now been forced to take measures to protect the interests of the German people and the economy of the Soviet zone. We are concerned about the people of Berlin and are trying to solve the problems about essential supplies. If the situation continues we will not hesitate to supply the whole of Berlin by ourselves.
Source C: A cartoon published in a widely read British newspaper, September 1948. The three figures represent Joseph Stalin, and Soviet politicians. The title, ‘No Go Joe’, refers to Joseph Stalin. The cartoon, on the opposite page, shows three men standing on each other’s shoulders. Two men, one of them is Stalin, have signs around their necks that read, ‘RAIL CLOSED’ and ‘ROAD CLOSED’. The man at the top is holding a large net in his hand and planes can be seen flying overhead. One of the planes is caught in the net. Behind the men, there is a railway barrier and an arrow–shaped sign pointing into the distance towards where the planes are flying. The sign reads ‘BERLIN’. Under the image are the words ‘NO GO JOE!’

## Answer:
Source B is useful to a historian studying the Berlin Blockade as it shows how USSR said the reasoning behind the Berlin Blockade was because they had no other option. It says soviets were forced to take measures as the America, France and Britain wouldn’t allow the agreement made at the between the powers. This is referring to the Yalta and Potsdam conferences in February and July of 1945 when the powers decided to split Berlin and Germany into 4 so in order to keep it weak after the war. Stalin saying the supporters weren’t following the agreement could be representative of how America, Britain and France joined their sectors together to make East and West Berlin which was a threat to Stalin as it made West Germany stronger. The provenance of this source is also useful to a Historian studying the blockade as it was written by Stalin in 1948 July just a month after he began the blockade in June so the purpose of this letter could have been to justify his actions in Berlin. Stalin paints USSR as the saviours by saying they are concerned about the people further and tries to say that he will help the whole of Berlin which is representative of how he did the blockade in order to force the west to allow him to have control over the whole of berlin.
Source C is also useful as it represents soviet politicians blocking the way saying ‘road and rails are closed which is what happened in the blockade, soviet troops blocked of all road and rail access to Berlin, The signpost for Berlin represents how it was access to Berlin that was cut of Source C is also useful as it shows planes flying in the direction of Berlin which represents the airlift that the west started to get supplies to blocked off Berlin. It also shows Stalin in top of both soldiers with a net representing how he was desperately trying to stop the airlift in order to gain control of West Germany. The provenance of this source is also useful as it was written in 1948 at this point the airlift was well underway and the west were successfully supplying west Berlin and determined to carry on doing so in order to prevent West Berlin falling to communism which would be a failure of the Truman Doctrine. It was also published in a British newspaper which is useful as it shows the Wests views on Stalin as he is presented as a ridiculous and idiotic figure as it would not be possible to stop the airlift with a net so the cartoon is ridiculing Stalin. It was also written in the middle of the airlift and supports the west which represents how they needed the support of the people of the west in order to carry on the airlift.
In conclusion I believe all sources are useful for a historian studying the blockade. B represents Soviets reasoning behind the blockade and C represents the west’s view of Stalin and of the blockade.

## Response:
The student achieves developed evaluation of both sources, by clearly referencing features of the content of the sources and then demonstrating a good range of accurate factual knowledge to evaluate them. The student then evaluates the provenance in a developed way, picking up different aspects of the provenance, for example, the author, the date and the purpose of the source and then evaluating how that might affect the source’s usefulness, for example, ‘so the purpose of this letter could have been to justify his actions in Berlin’.
This formula is repeated for source C, with the student first evaluating the content, showing good contextual knowledge and then evaluating several aspects of the provenance – the date and the fact it was published in a British newspaper. Again, level 3 is achieved by not just identifying who made the source but then explaining how that affects utility, for example ‘it was also published in a British newspaper which is useful as it shown the West’s views on Stalin’.
The answer concludes with a short overall judgement, which recognises that both sources are useful to show different aspects of the blockade. This satisfies the ‘sustained judgement’ part of level 4 criteria, topping off the ‘complex evaluation of both sources based on content and provenance’. Overall, this answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 12 marks.

## Answer:
Source A depicts the events at Kent State University, in which students were killed in an anti-Vietnam war protest. It shows the feelings of the American public at this stage, disappointed. It is critical because it shows the gun smoking, highlighting its use, and the caption below shows the cartoonists criticism of the use of excessive force.

## Response:
The student shows factual knowledge of the events ‘in which students were killed in an anti-Vietnam war protest’, and understanding of the meaning of the source ‘disappointed feelings of the American public at this stage’. They then explicitly explain why it is critical, highlighting the smoking gun and the use of excessive force, completing the developed analysis.

In Source B, Stalin is only offering to provide equipment rather than troops because he did not want direct confrontation with the USA. That is also the reason for the message being confidential.
    - The context of Source C is that President Truman had issued a doctrine to say that America would follow a policy to ‘contain’ the spread of communism. However, the propaganda poster shows that the USA did not want to be seen as starting a war against communism because it shows North Korea as the aggressor. It stresses that the action against North Korea has worldwide support and the USA was acting with the authorisation of the UN.

Source B is useful to a historian studying the Korean War because it shows the USSR’s involvement in the war and how they sided with North Korea. This was a confidential message which is useful because it shows how Stalin didn’t want the USA to know that he was working with the communist side as it would create another conflict directly between the USA and the USSR. It also tells us what he supplied to North Korea. He supplied ammunition and equipment but didn’t send troops. This was also 6 months before the North had invaded the South which shows he didn’t realise how the war would go and how big it would get. Source C is useful for a historian studying the Korean War as it shows the Republic of Korea struggling on the floor, helpless, with a much larger man representing the communist aggressors ready to attack him. However, a large hand representing the UN is reaching out to grab him to Save the South Koreans. This is referring to how the UN stepped in on South Korea’s side to contain communism and all the countries that made up the UN are charging from the outside to present the support given against the countries like North Korea, USSR and China. It was a US poster which shows how they thought the communists were ‘criminal’ and were using this as propaganda to make people in agreement of the UN’s involvement in the war.

## Response:
The student shows understanding of both sources and includes some accurate factual knowledge, for example saying ‘this was also 6 months before the North had invaded the South’ and ‘he supplied ammunition and equipment but didn’t send troops.’ The provenance and content are both analysed and there is some attempt to evaluate ‘this was a confidential message which is useful because…’ but this is not developed, or used consistently through the answer. Evaluation and links to utility are more often implied rather than clearly explained, using phrases such as ‘which shows’ or ‘this is referring to’, rather than explaining how this would be useful to an historian. This implied evaluation is level 2 – simple evaluation, even though both sources are addressed and there are references to both content and provenance. 
To reach level 3, the student would need to include ‘extended reasoning related to utility’ and a greater amount of factual knowledge to support this.
Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 6 marks.

## Context:
Source B: Adapted from a confidential message sent by Joseph Stalin, the leader of the USSR, to General Shtykov in January 1950. Shtykov was the main Soviet expert in Korean affairs. He became the first Soviet ambassador to North Korea in 1948 and shared Kim Il Sung’s wish to unify Korea.
Source C: A poster published in 1950 by the US Government after the UN agreement
regarding Korea. The poster, on the opposite page, shows a man in uniform, who is holding a club with spikes on and wearing a top with the words ‘COMMUNIST AGGRESSORS’ on. In front of him is a person lying on the ground, who is bleeding. The words‘Republic of Korea’ are underneath the person. Behind the man with the club, is a large hand with the letters ‘U.N.’ written on it. The hand is open and facing towards the man. Many smaller people, all holding different flags, can be seen surrounding the man. At the top of the poster it says ‘STOP! CRIMINAL!’. The text to the side of the image says ‘53 United Nations condemn the criminal Communist invasion of the Republic of Korea! The Communist warmakers will be stopped! Through United Nations – Peace!’

## Answer:
Source B is useful to a Historian as it first of all shows the USSR relations with North Korea and how exactly they helped. It states how he would provide ‘resources’ and any ‘other ammunition and equipment’ alongside any assistance of soviet specialists if needed. It shows to historians that the USSR provided resources but never directly got involved with the Korean War. Since the source us a confidential message sent by Stalin to Shtykov, a secret ambassador to North Korea, it is a trustworthy and useful source, as it was private, not to be released, message. Stalin’s two intentions and works are shown here. Therefore source B is useful, it is able to show the USSR relations with North Korea and is a confidential message, so has provenance.
Source C is useful to a Historian studying the Korean War as it is able to show how much the USA wanted to stop communism spreading to Korea. The headline ‘criminal’, showcases how the US thinks communism is a crime, backed up by ‘criminal communist invasions’, how it is pure evil. The poster also has illustrations of a hand (the UN) coming to grab a man (the
communist aggressors), who are beating down the Republic of Korea, even drawing blood. This illustration symbolises that the UN has now come to an intervene, because of the Truman Doctrine meaning that they are able to intervene and help countries in need from communism. The UN is going to ‘grab’ the people that decide to make the Republic of Korea communist, is what the poster essentially says. There’s also people running forward holding flags, and the text ’53 United Nations condemn’, symbolising how they to should and are going to come forward and get rid of the communist aggressors. Finally, the text ‘Through United Nations – peace’ shows how the UN are doing this for peace.
Therefore source B and C are useful to Historians studying the Korean war as they are able to see the USSR’s exact relations, and relationships, with communist North Korea. Also, they are able to see the inherent threat USA has to stop communism spreading to Korea.

## Response:
The student shows understanding of the content of source B, bringing in some simple knowledge ‘the USSR provided resources but never directly got involved’ and evaluates the provenance well, explaining that ‘since the source is a confidential message….it is a trustworthy and useful source, as it was private, not to be released, message’. This developed evaluation opens up the possibility of level 3, depending on whether source C is addressed. 
For source C, they focus more on the content of the source, and describe the source, explaining its meaning, which is the basic analysis required for level 1. There is some simple evaluation ‘it is able to show how much the USA wanted to stop communism spreading to Korea’ but most of the paragraph is analysis, describing features of the source and explaining what they mean. Paragraph 2 falls into level 2. To get to level 3 there would need to be a greater focus on evaluation rather than analysis, either of the content or provenance, which isn’t mentioned for source C.
Overall, this answer falls into level 3, due to the level 3 developed evaluation in the first paragraph, but would be awarded 8 marks, as the second paragraph is not developed.

The text to the side of the image says ‘53 United Nations condemn the criminal Communist invasion of the Republic of Korea! The Communist warmakers will be stopped! Through United Nations – Peace!’

## Answer:
Source B is very useful to a historian studying the Korean War because it says ‘I am ready to help him’. At this time North Korea kept asking for Stalin’s permission to invade the south. However, up until June 1950, Stalin refused because he wanted to have sufficient military equipment and develop nuclear weapons. This means that the source is useful as it shows that Stalin was getting ready to help North Vietnam which led to the Korean War. Also the source is a confidential message, hence it is useful as Stalin had no reason to not tell the truth. This is useful to a historian as it shows the true cause leading up to the Korean War.
Source C is quite useful to a historian as it shows a big and evil looking communist aggressor attacking the Republic of Korea. It then has the UN trying to stop the communist. At this time, the UN passed resolution 84 which was the agreement to support Korea. This was mainly caused by US persuasion at the UN because the USSR had been boycotting the UN at this time. This means that the US government were trying to gain the public’s support in America and make communism look like an issue regarding them. Therefore, this source is useful to a historian studying the Korean War as it shows why the US wanted to intervene and how they tried to gain public support.
Overall the sources are most useful as a pair. This is because source B gives background information on how the USSR would get involved in the Korean War. Whereas source C gives information for why the US wanted to get involved. Therefore, together they present a well rounded idea for the beginning of the Korean War

## Response:
The student approaches the answer in a methodical fashion, starting by analysing the sources, showing what they show or say, then bringing in some factual knowledge to put them into context. For source B they say ‘At this time North Korea kept asking for Stalin’s permission….’, for source C, they talk about resolution 84 of the UN. The focus on utility is explicit in both paragraphs, ‘This means that the source is useful as it shows…’ ‘Therefore, this source is useful….’. The student also addresses the provenance of both sources. For source B they evaluate the fact that it is a confidential message ‘hence it is useful as Stalin had no reason not to tell the truth’, and for source C they evaluate the purpose ‘the US government were trying to gain the public’s support in America…. Therefore, this source is useful….’. The developed evaluation and extended reasoning based on content and provenance for both sources, places this answer into level 4.
In the final paragraph, the candidate attempts to evaluate the two sources together, another level 4 indicator ‘evaluate the relationship between the sources’. This isn’t complex enough to reach the top of the level but secures the level 4.
Overall, the answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 11 marks.

## Context:
Source A: A cartoon published on an American news website in 2010. Former American President, George W Bush, is signing copies of his memoirs. The figure on the right is President Barack Obama who took over from Bush as President in 2009.
The book covers Bush’s time as President including the invasion of Iraq, and his ‘Mission Accomplished’ speech.

## Answer:
Source A is made to look critical of George Bush as it shows Barack Obama saying ‘can you sign it’ ‘to barrack sorry about the mess I left you’. This shows an indirect dig at George bush’s leadership and country managing skills. This is also backed up by the visual evidence known to man. The invasion of Iraq created many problems for Mr Bush and the American government. Creating many to hate on the US. This then lead to many terrorist attacks in response to the unrightfully tyrany.

## Response:
The student identifies a relevant feature of the source – Obama asking Bush to sign his copy – and explains what this means – ‘an indirect dig at Bush’s leadership and managing skills’. They bring in some simple factual knowledge to support ‘this is backed up by…’ this is quite simplistic though ‘creating many to hate on the US’. To get to level 2 there would need to be a greater focus on why the source is critical and some more specific factual knowledge to support it. Overall, the answer falls into level 1 and should be awarded 2 marks.

The book covers Bush’s time as President including the invasion of Iraq, and his ‘Mission Accomplished’ speech.

## Answer:
In the text Obama asks Bush to write ‘sorry about the mess I left you’ referencing the multiple shortcomings of his presidency. Bush was criticised for a huge scandal in the days following 9/11 which planted false evidence that made it appear as Saddam Hussein. A forged dossier pointed to Saddam possessing nuclear weapons, which he’d agreed to not own in the 1991 peace treaty. Bush then used the forged evidence in his dossier to reignite conflict in Iraq. The conflict in Iraq. The public dossier was fake. The second Gulf War made many middle-eastern people very angry at the west, causing a sharp spike in the size of terrorist groups. Due to this, Obama was left a nation of angered people and a growing terrorist threat.

## Response:
The student identifies a relevant feature of the source – Obama asking Bush to sign his copy – and explains what this is a reference to. There is ‘extended reasoning’ supported by factual knowledge about Bush’s shortcomings as President and the ‘mess’ that he had left for Obama. There could be stronger focus on the issue of how it is critical of Bush, but this is addressed in the second sentence ‘Bush was criticised for a huge scandal’ and the depth of knowledge used to substantiate this places this answer into level 2. Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 4 marks.

## Context:
Source B: A cartoon published in many American newspapers, September 2001. The giant in the doorway represents the United States.
Source C: From a speech made by British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to Parliament shortly after the 11 September attacks in 2001.
'Killing so many innocent and defenceless people can never be justified. The world needs to stand together and bring those responsible to justice. President Bush has been careful not to strike first and only think about it afterwards.
The United Nations Security Council has passed a resolution to combat terrorism and now we need to think about how to fight terrorists. We have to stop their training, funding and supply of weapons. We will do whatever is necessary'.

## Answer:
After the 9/11 attacks America sent thousand of soldiers into middle-eastern countries to try and eradicate terrorism, This sudden response was prompted by the 9/11 attacks. Sources A depicts a rat labelled as ‘Terrorism’ retreating from a large muscular figure in the hat often depicted on ‘Uncle Sam’, a figure used in many World War 2 posters. Uncle Sam is meant to represent America as a whole. Terrorists were often referred to as ‘rats’ by many people so the use of one makes terrorists seem weak and cowardly, a view shared by many at the time, Another common viewpoint to this day is that America is a giant,both economically and in in terms of military might. This personification of these views makes America look for stronger than terrorists, a common mindset of the people at the time. The cartoon would show a historian the American mindset at the time.
The speech by British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is useful to historians as it shows British support of American and global due to the UN’s new resolution. A global resolution against terrorism, created by the most powerful nations at the time showed how the world responded to terrorism with quick and decisive moves. The speech also strongly supports Bush as Blair claims that Bush is careful to ‘not strike first’, making it appear that America wasn’t interested in conflict. This makes America look good as it implies they don’t want a war where countless would die, allowing 100% of the blame to be place on terrorism. A historian would be able to understand that terrorism was recognised as a global threat that was being taken very seriously.

## Response:
The student quickly shows understanding of both sources, and develops their analysis by identifying and explaining the meaning of several features of each. There is some evaluation of utility in both paragraphs: in paragraph 1 ‘the cartoon would show a historian the American mindset at the time’ and in paragraph 2 ‘The speech… is useful to historians as it shows…’, ‘A historian would be able to understand that terrorism was recognised as a global threat’.  There is very little mention of the provenance of the sources and this isn’t related to utility, so the answer will not fall into level 4. However, there is some developed evaluation of the content of both, so level 3 does apply. In both sources, the evaluation could be developed further with more factual knowledge and a more consistent focus on utility. Therefore, overall, the answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 8 marks.

    - Taken together the sources are useful because they illustrate how the US and its allies quickly reacted to the attacks
    - Source B shows the confidence that Americans had in their power in the face of a terrified enemy
    - The artist that created Source B was trying to paint an image of the ability of the US to assert its strength
    - This contrasts with Source C which looked for a wider response and urged countries to stand together and work with the UN to undermine and weaken terrorism
    - The reality was that while NATO stood with the US, the UN was more cautious, despite Blair’s appeal, it did not vote for military action

## Context:
Source B: A cartoon published in many American newspapers, September 2001. The giant in the doorway represents the United States.
Source C: From a speech made by British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to Parliament shortly after the 11 September attacks in 2001.
'Killing so many innocent and defenceless people can never be justified. The world needs to stand together and bring those responsible to justice. President Bush has been careful not to strike first and only think about it afterwards.
The United Nations Security Council has passed a resolution to combat terrorism and now we need to think about how to fight terrorists. We have to stop their training, funding and supply of weapons. We will do whatever is necessary'.

## Answer:
Both sources are useful to a certain extent as they show that after 9/11 attacks, American foreign policy shifted slightly to the combatting of terrorism and revenge for this attack upon the American people.
The American cartoon presents the United States a big, muscly character, providing comfort to the American people that President Bush’s government is willing to go to great lengths for revenge from the 9/11 attacks. Terrorism is presented as a rat which shows that it is feeble and able to be defeated by the American government. This is useful to a historian because it was published in September 2001after the 9/11 attacks showing the plans for the ‘war on terror’ and how the United States are following the terrorism in Afghanistan where Al-Qaeda were believed to be rising.
Tony Blair’s speech shows how it wasn’t just America that was inciting revenge onto global terrorism. This was becoming a global crusade. The UN Security Council allowed America to use defence to protect and defend themselves after 9/11 attacks. This was followed by Operation Enduring Freedom which aimed to get revenge for the attacks. This is useful to a historian as it shows that the UK were supportive of whatever the US put out as their plan and aims to top the growth and development of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda ‘training, funding and supply of weapons.’
Both sources are useful to a historian to a certain extent as it shows the preface and planning of the war on terror. It also shows that the public opinion was sympathetic towards America and many countries (such as the UK) supported Americas plans to invade Afghanistan after 9/11. It is also useful because it shows that the US and UK were willing to go to any lengths necessary to get revenge for the attacks and to reduce global terrorism around the globe by neutralising the threats posed by Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and other terrorist organisation.

## Response:
There is a clear attempt in the answer to consider the relationship between the sources, both at the start and end, which is one of the criteria for level 4. However, the content and provenance of both sources needs to be evaluated in a developed way for this to be relevant.
In the second paragraph, the student identifies relevant features of the content of source B and explains the meaning of the cartoon. In the second half of the paragraph, they provide evaluation of the provenance ‘it was published in September 2001 after the 9/11 attacks’ and the content ‘showing the plans for the war on terror and how the US are following the terrorism…’. There is some factual knowledge used to develop this, with the mention of Afghanistan and Al-Qaeda.
In the third paragraph, the student evaluates source C, explaining its meaning and using factual knowledge to develop this further, with the mention of the UN Security Council and Operation Enduring Freedom. There is clear evaluation of the content with ‘this is useful to an historian…’. The evaluation of the provenance is weaker here, though it is implied with the mention of the source being a speech by Tony Blair. 
The final paragraph develops the evaluation further, treating both sources together, though again the evaluation of content is stronger that that of provenance. However, both the content and provenance of both sources are evaluated, even if it isn’t consistently developed.
Overall, the answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 11 marks.
