## Context:
Source A: A painting entitled 'The Harvest of Battle', by the British artist, CWR Nevinson, 1919. It was painted as part of a record for the First World War. Nevinson based his painting on sketches made during a visit to the Western Front in 1917.

## Answer:
Because it shows that Japan is walking over the league of nations and entering League of
Nations Headquarters. It shows that Japan is in charge because the person behind the door
bowing to him and has got flower in his hand.

## Response:
Response A demonstrates ‘simple analysis’ with a description of what is shown in the source. It does not demonstrate the developed analysis, showing factual knowledge and understanding, as there is no additional knowledge shown and the student does not explain how that image is critical of the League of Nations. It identifies two relevant features of the source and so would be given 2 marks. Overall, this answer falls into level 1 and should be awarded 2 marks.

Source A: A painting entitled 'The Harvest of Battle', by the British artist, CWR Nevinson, 1919. It was painted as part of a record for the First World War. Nevinson based his painting on sketches made during a visit to the Western Front in 1917.

## Answer:
We know this as the cartoon was published in 1933. This was after the Manchurian Crisis
which was detrimental to the league, showing it had no real power as it could not stop Japan
from invading Manchuria. When they did invade, all the league could do was tell them off but
Japan simply ignored them.
In the image Japan is depicted as walking over the league. This is in reference to the fact that
Japan completely ignored them and did whatever they wanted to. This was Japan undermining
the league of nations and showing how it can be completely ignored and walked all over. We
know this as the league had no army to force Japan to stop.

## Response:
Response B shows some ‘developed analysis’ evidenced by their inclusion of factual knowledge and understanding. This is shown in the first paragraph where the student identifies the date it was made then says why that was significant, showing some knowledge: “This was after the Manchurian Crisis which was detrimental to the league, showing it had no real power as it could not stop Japan from invading Manchuria. When they did invade, all the league could do was tell them off but Japan simply ignored them.”
In the second paragraph, the student picks out a detail from the content of the source (Japan walking over the League) and then shows understanding by explaining how that is critical, and adding the factual knowledge, that the League had no army of its own.
Overall, this answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 4 marks.

## Question:
How useful are Sources B and C to an historian studying the policy of appeasement?
Explain your answer using Source B and C and your contextual knowledge.

  criteria:
    - Evaluation based on content and provenance
  progression:
    - Students may progress from a developed evaluation of the sources by complex reasoning related to utility on the basis of content and provenance.
    - They may evaluate the relationship between the sources based on analysis of provenance and contextual knowledge.
  example_answers:
    - The sources are useful to show how difficult it was for the governments of the time to respond to the threats posed by Hitler. The Munich Agreement mentioned in Source B was the work of several countries, not just Britain alone, therefore the responsibility for giving in to his demands is a shared one. The American view in Source C is useful to show that even countries outside Europe were concerned with the issue of Czechoslovakia and the policy of appeasement.

  criteria:
    - Evaluation based on content and/or provenance
  progression:
    - Students may progress from a simple evaluation of the sources with extended reasoning related to utility on the basis of content and/or provenance.
  example_answers:
    - Source B is useful for showing a positive view of appeasement as Chamberlain presented it to the people of Britain. The Munich Agreement allowed Hitler to occupy the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia despite it not being German land. However, in return for this concession, Chamberlain secured the Anglo-German declaration which was a promise that war would be avoided.
    - Source C is critical of Chamberlain for thinking that Hitler will be content with the concessions. The Munich Agreement had allowed Hitler to take over land in Czechoslovakia. Hitler had promised not to make any further demands for more territory but many people at the time thought he would try and take more land.
    - Source C is useful because it shows an opinion from outside Europe that was critical of Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement. The cartoon reflects the view that by giving into Hitler the Munich Agreement would encourage his territorial ambitions even further. This prediction came true when Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939. Source B shows why, in the short term, appeasement seemed to have worked. Chamberlain wanted to use discussion to avoid war with Hitler and Source B was seen as evidence that he had achieved his aim.

## Context:
Source B: Adapted from a statement issued by Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler
following the signing of the Munich Agreement, in September 1938.

"We, the German Chancellor and British Prime Minister, have met again and
agreed that the relationship between our countries is most important both for
ourselves and Europe. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 and the
successful Munich conference show our countries’ desire to avoid war between
us. We are determined that talking shall be the way of solving any issues
concerning our two countries."

Source C: A cartoon published in a widely read and respected American newspaper,
7 October 1938.

## Answer:
Source B is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement. In the source it says ‘The
Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935’ and ‘desire to avoid war’ from my contextual
knowledge I know that Britian signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement with Germany
stating that Germany can have a navy half the size of Britain’s- This was banned in the Treaty
of Versailles but Britain did it to avoid war, this is the policy of appeasement. The nature of
this source is a statement from Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler in 1938. This means that
this source is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement as it shows the policy in
action.
Source C is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement. In the source it says
‘HE’LL BE QUIET NOW MAYBE’. This shows a figure named Chamberlain saying this. I can also
see a baby sleeping with a bottle name ‘Munich agreement’ this baby also has a Swastika on
it’s cot. From my contextual knowledge I know that Britain gave Hitler what he wanted in the
Munich agreement to avoid war. The nature of this source is a cartoon published in October
1938. It’s origin is a American newspaper. The purpose of this source is to mock Neville
Chamberlain, as many Americans thought he was weak for giving Hitler so many concessions
at the Munich conference. 

## Response:
The candidate describes (or analyses, in the words of the mark scheme) both sources – saying what they can see and what the sources show about appeasement. This is what is needed for level 1.
For level 2, the candidate needs to offer simple evaluation based on content and/or provenance. This involves bringing in some contextual or own knowledge. In source B the student has done this, though the knowledge isn’t detailed (for example, the point about the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles could be developed further) or entirely accurate (for example the agreement allowed Germany 35% of Britain’s navy, not half). However, there is enough for level 2. The student has addressed both the content of the source and the provenance briefly (talking about the nature of the source and evaluating this in a simple way). The lack of detailed knowledge holds this answer in level 2 and it lacks the ‘extended reasoning’ required for level 3.
For source C, the student has again provided some simple evaluation of the source, again the knowledge shown isn’t particularly detailed. However, the evaluation of the provenance is stronger here, showing some extended reasoning, evidenced by the point about American attitudes and why the source was made – therefore making it useful to show attitudes to appeasement. It is the slightly better developed point at the end of the second paragraph that pushes the answer into level 3. Overall, the answer falls into a low level 3 and should be awarded 7 marks.

## Context:

Source C: A cartoon published in a widely read and respected American newspaper,

## Answer:
Source B is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement as it reveals the Prime
minister, Chamberlain, and Hitler’s intentions behind signing it. The source state the policy
shows “our countries” desire to avoid war”, we know this to be true as the munich Agreement
allowed Hitler to reclaim the Sudetenland in return for no further invasions which could’ve
lead to war. This is also useful in revealing public opinions – British and German citizens did
not want war following the horrors and deaths of the first World War. Chamberlain claims he
achieved ‘peace in our time’ through his policy of appeasement and the source supports the
notion that he believed Germany would retain peace. The provenance of the source reveals
that if is an adaptation of the statement issued by Chamberlain and Hitler; this first hand
account gives validity to it’s content in expressing the truce claims behind the of
appeasement.
Source C is useful to historians studying the policy of appeasement as it reveals attitudes of
opposition towards it the source depicts Hitler as a baby, suggestion he is childish and erratic,
being pacified by a bottle labelled ‘the Munich Agreement’. This suggest Chamberlain’s policy
would only temporarily stop Hitler and that, when the bottle is empty he will continue to do as
he pleases. Historians know this to be true as following the proposed reclaiming of the
Sudetenland, Hitler would go on to invade Czechoslovakia. This broke the policy of
appeasement as Hitler had no claim over the land and took it forcefully. These ideas are
furthered by the text ‘Shh-hh! He’ll be quite now-maybe!’ suggesting to Historians that
Chamberlain know the policy would only be a temporary solution. The provenance reveals
this cartoon was published in an American newspaper. At the time America practiced
isolationism from European affairs, therefore the source is useful to historians as it reveals
unbiased public opinions, of the time about effectiveness of the policy of appeasement.

## Response:
This candidate shows developed evaluation and a good level of contextual knowledge – the student brings in a lot of knowledge about the events before and after the Munich Agreement – but also the student demonstrates ‘extended reasoning relating to utility’ as evidenced by the way that almost every point is brought back to an evaluation of the source, for example, “This is also useful in revealing public opinions”, “the source supports the notion that he believed Germany would retain peace” “this first hand account gives validity to its content”. Both sources are dealt with equally well, demonstrating the ‘complex evaluation of both sources with sustained judgement’ which is required for level 4. The relationship between the sources could be dealt with in a more explicit way, though it is implied where the student compares the attitude of Hitler and Chamberlain in source B with the opposition in source C. To reach the top of the level, the student could have also included more specific factual detail, such as dates or detail about the Four Powers Conference. Overall, the answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 11 marks.
