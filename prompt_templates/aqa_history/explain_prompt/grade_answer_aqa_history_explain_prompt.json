Your task is to grade exam questions according to a given mark scheme. \n    You will be given a Question, Answer, Context and a Mark Scheme to grade the Answer.\n\n    Follow these detailed instructions:\n\n    1. **Understand the Levels and Descriptors:**\n    - Review the mark scheme to understand the different levels and their descriptors. Each level descriptor represents the average performance expected for that level.\n\n    2. **Annotate the Answer:**\n    - Read through the student\u2019s answer and annotate it based on the qualities outlined in the mark scheme. Highlight the key points that align with the descriptors.\n\n    3. **Determine a Level:**\n    - Start at the lowest level of the mark scheme and check if the answer meets the criteria for that level.\n    - If it does, move to the next level and repeat until you find the highest level the answer meets.\n    - Consider the overall quality of the answer, rather than focusing on minor errors.\n    - Use a best-fit approach if the answer includes elements from multiple levels, placing it in the level that best matches the predominant quality.\n\n    4. **Determine a Mark:**\n    - Once a level is assigned, decide on the specific mark within that level.\n    - Compare the student\u2019s answer to exemplar materials provided during standardization, which include answers with assigned marks by the Lead Examiner.\n    - Use these comparisons to judge if the student's answer is of the same, better, or worse standard than the example, and assign a mark accordingly.\n\n    5. **Use Indicative Content as a Guide:**\n    - The indicative content in the mark scheme is a guide and not exhaustive. Credit valid points made by the student even if they are not listed in the indicative content.\n    - Students do not need to cover all points in the indicative content to achieve the highest level.\n\n    6. **Award No Marks for Irrelevant Answers:**\n    - If an answer contains nothing relevant to the question, award zero marks.\n\n    7. **Review as Necessary:**\n    - Re-read the student\u2019s answer as needed to ensure the level and mark are appropriate and accurately reflect the answer\u2019s quality.\n\n    By following these steps, you can accurately grade student answers according to the mark scheme, ensuring consistency and fairness in the evaluation process. \n\n    Provide a thorough step-by-step explanation of your reasoning. \n    Below are some examples of how to grade student answers:\n    \n\nQuestion:\nSource A is critical of the League of Nations. How do you know? Explain your answer using Source A and your contextual knowledge.\n\nMark Scheme:\nLevel_2:\n  description:\n    - Developed analysis of source based on content and/or provenance\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 4\n    minimum: 3\n  criteria:\n    - Students may progress from a simple analysis of the source with extended reasoning supported by factual knowledge and understanding related to the features of the source.\n  progression: None\n  example_answers:\n    - The cartoon is critical of the League of Nations because it was produced at the time of the Manchurian Crisis when the League failed to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.\n    - The title of the cartoon suggests that Japan is ignoring the League of Nations.\n\nLevel_1:\n  description:\n    - Simple analysis of source based on content and/or provenance\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 2\n    minimum: 1\n  criteria:\n    - Students identify relevant features in the source and support them with simple factual knowledge and understanding.\n  progression: None\n  example_answers:\n    - The cartoon shows that Japan is walking all over the League of Nations.\n\nLevel_0:\n  description:\n    - Students either submit no evidence or fail to address the question\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 0\n    minimum: 0\n  criteria:\n  progression: None\n  example_answers:\n\nContext:\nSource A: A painting entitled 'The Harvest of Battle', by the British artist, CWR Nevinson, 1919. It was painted as part of a record for the First World War. Nevinson based his painting on sketches made during a visit to the Western Front in 1917.\n\nAnswer:\nBecause it shows that Japan is walking over the league of nations and entering League of Nations Headquarters. It shows that Japan is in charge because the person behind the door bowing to him and has got flower in his hand.\n\nResponse:\nResponse A demonstrates \u2018simple analysis\u2019 with a description of what is shown in the source. It does not demonstrate the developed analysis, showing factual knowledge and understanding, as there is no additional knowledge shown and the student does not explain how that image is critical of the League of Nations. It identifies two relevant features of the source and so would be given 2 marks. Overall, this answer falls into level 1 and should be awarded 2 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nSource A is critical of the League of Nations. How do you know?

It was painted as part of a record for the First World War. Nevinson based his painting on sketches made during a visit to the Western Front in 1917.\n\nAnswer:\nWe know this as the cartoon was published in 1933. This was after the Manchurian Crisis which was detrimental to the league, showing it had no real power as it could not stop Japan from invading Manchuria. When they did invade, all the league could do was tell them off but Japan simply ignored them. In the image Japan is depicted as walking over the league. This is in reference to the fact that Japan completely ignored them and did whatever they wanted to. This was Japan undermining the league of nations and showing how it can be completely ignored and walked all over. We know this as the league had no army to force Japan to stop.\n\nResponse:\nResponse B shows some \u2018developed analysis\u2019 evidenced by their inclusion of factual knowledge and understanding. This is shown in the first paragraph where the student identifies the date it was made then says why that was significant, showing some knowledge: \u201cThis was after the Manchurian Crisis which was detrimental to the league, showing it had no real power as it could not stop Japan from invading Manchuria. When they did invade, all the league could do was tell them off but Japan simply ignored them.\u201d In the second paragraph, the student picks out a detail from the content of the source (Japan walking over the League) and then shows understanding by explaining how that is critical, and adding the factual knowledge, that the League had no army of its own. Overall, this answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 4 marks.\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nMark Scheme:\n{mark_scheme}\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nAnswer:\n{answer}\n\nResponse:\n",
