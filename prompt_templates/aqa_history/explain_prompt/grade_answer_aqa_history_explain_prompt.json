Your task is to grade exam questions according to a given mark scheme. \n    You will be given a Question, Answer and a Mark Scheme to grade the Answer.\n    Follow these detailed instructions:\n    1. **Understand the Levels and Descriptors:**\n    - Review the mark scheme to understand the different levels and their descriptors. Each level descriptor represents the average performance expected for that level.\n\n    2. **Annotate the Answer:**\n    - Read through the student\u2019s answer and annotate it based on the qualities outlined in the mark scheme. Highlight the key points that align with the descriptors.\n\n    3. **Determine a Level:**\n    - Start at the lowest level of the mark scheme and check if the answer meets the criteria for that level.\n    - If it does, move to the next level and repeat until you find the highest level the answer meets.\n    - Consider the overall quality of the answer, rather than focusing on minor errors.\n    - Use a best-fit approach if the answer includes elements from multiple levels, placing it in the level that best matches the predominant quality.\n    - Be strict with criteria for each level.\n\n    4. **Determine a Mark:**\n    - Once a level is assigned, decide on the specific mark within that level.\n    - Compare the student\u2019s answer to exemplar materials provided during standardization, which include answers with assigned marks by the Lead Examiner.\n    - Use these comparisons to judge if the student's answer is of the same, better, or worse standard than the example, and assign a mark accordingly.\n\n    5. **Use Indicative Content as a Guide:**\n    - The indicative content in the mark scheme is a guide and not exhaustive. Credit valid points made by the student even if they are not listed in the indicative content.\n    - Students do not need to cover all points in the indicative content to achieve the highest level.\n\n    6. **Award No Marks for Irrelevant Answers:**\n    - If an answer contains nothing relevant to the question, award zero marks.\n    - If the answer is blank, award zero marks.\n\n    7. **Review as Necessary:**\n    - Re-read the student\u2019s answer as needed to ensure the level and mark are appropriate and accurately reflect the answer\u2019s quality.\n\n    By following these steps, you can accurately grade student answers according to the mark scheme, ensuring consistency and fairness in the evaluation process.\n    Report the Response/ Examiner Commentary only. Do not invent anything.\n    Below are examples to guide you.\n\nQuestion:\nSource A is critical of the League of Nations. How do you know?

It was painted as part of a record for the First World War. Nevinson based his painting on sketches made during a visit to the Western Front in 1917.\n\nAnswer:\nBecause it shows that Japan is walking over the league of nations and entering League of\nNations Headquarters. It shows that Japan is in charge because the person behind the door\nbowing to him and has got flower in his hand.\n\nResponse:\nResponse A demonstrates \u2018simple analysis\u2019 with a description of what is shown in the source. It does not demonstrate the developed analysis, showing factual knowledge and understanding, as there is no additional knowledge shown and the student does not explain how that image is critical of the League of Nations. It identifies two relevant features of the source and so would be given 2 marks. Overall, this answer falls into level 1 and should be awarded 2 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nSource A is critical of the League of Nations. How do you know?

It was painted as part of a record for the First World War. Nevinson based his painting on sketches made during a visit to the Western Front in 1917.\n\nAnswer:\nWe know this as the cartoon was published in 1933. This was after the Manchurian Crisis\nwhich was detrimental to the league, showing it had no real power as it could not stop Japan\nfrom invading Manchuria. When they did invade, all the league could do was tell them off but\nJapan simply ignored them.\nIn the image Japan is depicted as walking over the league. This is in reference to the fact that\nJapan completely ignored them and did whatever they wanted to. This was Japan undermining\nthe league of nations and showing how it can be completely ignored and walked all over. We\nknow this as the league had no army to force Japan to stop.\n\nResponse:\nResponse B shows some \u2018developed analysis\u2019 evidenced by their inclusion of factual knowledge and understanding. This is shown in the first paragraph where the student identifies the date it was made then says why that was significant, showing some knowledge: \u201cThis was after the Manchurian Crisis which was detrimental to the league, showing it had no real power as it could not stop Japan from invading Manchuria. When they did invade, all the league could do was tell them off but Japan simply ignored them.\u201d\nIn the second paragraph, the student picks out a detail from the content of the source (Japan walking over the League) and then shows understanding by explaining how that is critical, and adding the factual knowledge, that the League had no army of its own.\nOverall, this answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 4 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow useful are Sources B and C to an historian studying the policy of appeasement?\nExplain your answer using Source B and C and your contextual knowledge.\n\nMark Scheme:\nLevel_4:\n  description:\n    - Complex evaluation of both sources with sustained judgement\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 12\n    minimum: 10\n  criteria:\n    - Evaluation based on content and provenance\n  progression:\n    - Students may progress from a developed evaluation of the sources by complex reasoning related to utility on the basis of content and provenance.\n    - They may evaluate the relationship between the sources based on analysis of provenance and contextual knowledge.\n  example_answers:\n    - The sources are useful to show how difficult it was for the governments of the time to respond to the threats posed by Hitler. The Munich Agreement mentioned in Source B was the work of several countries, not just Britain alone, therefore the responsibility for giving in to his demands is a shared one. The American view in Source C is useful to show that even countries outside Europe were concerned with the issue of Czechoslovakia and the policy of appeasement.\n\nLevel_3:\n  description:\n    - Developed evaluation of sources based on the content and/or provenance\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 9\n    minimum: 7\n  criteria:\n    - Evaluation based on content and/or provenance\n  progression:\n    - Students may progress from a simple evaluation of the sources with extended reasoning related to utility on the basis of content and/or provenance.\n  example_answers:\n    - Source B is useful for showing a positive view of appeasement as Chamberlain presented it to the people of Britain. The Munich Agreement allowed Hitler to occupy the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia despite it not being German land. However, in return for this concession, Chamberlain secured the Anglo-German declaration which was a promise that war would be avoided.\n    - Source C is critical of Chamberlain for thinking that Hitler will be content with the concessions. The Munich Agreement had allowed Hitler to take over land in Czechoslovakia. Hitler had promised not to make any further demands for more territory but many people at the time thought he would try and take more land.\n    - Source C is useful because it shows an opinion from outside Europe that was critical of Chamberlain\u2019s policy of appeasement. The cartoon reflects the view that by giving into Hitler the Munich Agreement would encourage his territorial ambitions even further. This prediction came true when Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939. Source B shows why, in the short term, appeasement seemed to have worked. Chamberlain wanted to use discussion to avoid war with Hitler and Source B was seen as evidence that he had achieved his aim.\n\nLevel_2:\n  description:\n    - Simple evaluation of source(s) based on content and/or provenance\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 6\n    minimum: 4\n  criteria:\n    - Evaluation based on content and/or provenance\n  progression:\n    - Students may progress from a basic analysis of the source(s) to simple evaluation of the content and/or provenance.\n  example_answers:\n    - Source B shows that appeasement seemed to have worked. Chamberlain wanted to use discussion to avoid war with Hitler and this joint statement was seen as evidence that he had achieved his aim.\n    - Source C is criticising appeasement. The American cartoon is saying the Munich Agreement might not keep Hitler quiet for long. The Munich Agreement had allowed Hitler to take over land in Czechoslovakia. Hitler had promised not to make any further demands for more territory\n\nLevel_1:\n  description:\n    - Basic analysis of sources(s)\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 3\n    minimum: 1\n  criteria:\n    - Understanding/support for one or both sources, but the case is made by assertion/basic inference.\n  progression:\n    - Students identify basic features which are valid about the sources and related to the enquiry point.\n  example_answers:\n    - Source B says that Germany and Britain agreed never to go to war.\n    - Source C shows that Chamberlain is trying to keep Hitler quiet.\nLevel_0:\n  description:\n    - No evidence or fails to address the question\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 0\n    minimum: 0\n  criteria:\n    - No criteria met\n  progression:\n    - None\n  example_answers:\n    - None\n\nContext:\nSource B: Adapted from a statement issued by Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler\nfollowing the signing of the Munich Agreement, in September 1938.\n\n\"We, the German Chancellor and British Prime Minister, have met again and\nagreed that the relationship between our countries is most important both for\nourselves and Europe. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 and the\nsuccessful Munich conference show our countries\u2019 desire to avoid war between\nus. We are determined that talking shall be the way of solving any issues\nconcerning our two countries.\"\n\nSource C: A cartoon published in a widely read and respected American newspaper,\n7 October 1938.\n\nAnswer:\nSource B is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement. In the source it says \u2018The\nAnglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935\u2019 and \u2018desire to avoid war\u2019 from my contextual\nknowledge I know that Britian signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement with Germany\nstating that Germany can have a navy half the size of Britain\u2019s- This was banned in the Treaty\nof Versailles but Britain did it to avoid war, this is the policy of appeasement. The nature of\nthis source is a statement from Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler in 1938. This means that\nthis source is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement as it shows the policy in\naction.\nSource C is useful to a historian studying the policy of appeasement. In the source it says\n\u2018HE\u2019LL BE QUIET NOW MAYBE\u2019. This shows a figure named Chamberlain saying this. I can also\nsee a baby sleeping with a bottle name \u2018Munich agreement\u2019 this baby also has a Swastika on\nit\u2019s cot. From my contextual knowledge I know that Britain gave Hitler what he wanted in the\nMunich agreement to avoid war. The nature of this source is a cartoon published in October\n1938. It\u2019s origin is a American newspaper. The purpose of this source is to mock Neville\nChamberlain, as many Americans thought he was weak for giving Hitler so many concessions\nat the Munich conference.\n\nResponse:\nThe candidate describes (or analyses, in the words of the mark scheme) both sources \u2013 saying what they can see and what the sources show about appeasement. This is what is needed for level 1.\nFor level 2, the candidate needs to offer simple evaluation based on content and/or provenance. This involves bringing in some contextual or own knowledge. In source B the student has done this, though the knowledge isn\u2019t detailed (for example, the point about the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles could be developed further) or entirely accurate (for example the agreement allowed Germany 35% of Britain\u2019s navy, not half). However, there is enough for level 2. The student has addressed both the content of the source and the provenance briefly (talking about the nature of the source and evaluating this in a simple way). The lack of detailed knowledge holds this answer in level 2 and it lacks the \u2018extended reasoning\u2019 required for level 3.\nFor source C, the student has again provided some simple evaluation of the source, again the knowledge shown isn\u2019t particularly detailed. However, the evaluation of the provenance is stronger here, showing some extended reasoning, evidenced by the point about American attitudes and why the source was made \u2013 therefore making it useful to show attitudes to appeasement. It is the slightly better developed point at the end of the second paragraph that pushes the answer into level 3. Overall, the answer falls into a low level 3 and should be awarded 7 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow useful are Sources B and C to an historian studying the policy of appeasement?\nExplain your answer using Source B and C and your contextual knowledge.\n\nMark Scheme:\nLevel_4:\n  description: \n    - Complex evaluation of both sources with sustained judgement\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 12\n    minimum: 10\n  criteria:\n    - Evaluation based on content and provenance\n  progression: \n    - Students may progress from a developed evaluation of the sources by complex reasoning related to utility on the basis of content and provenance.\n    - They may evaluate the relationship between the sources based on analysis of provenance and contextual knowledge.\n  example_answers: \n    - The sources are useful to show how difficult it was for the governments of the time to respond to the threats posed by Hitler.

The source state the policy\nshows \u201cour countries\u201d desire to avoid war\u201d, we know this to be true as the munich Agreement\nallowed Hitler to reclaim the Sudetenland in return for no further invasions which could\u2019ve\nlead to war. This is also useful in revealing public opinions \u2013 British and German citizens did\nnot want war following the horrors and deaths of the first World War. Chamberlain claims he\nachieved \u2018peace in our time\u2019 through his policy of appeasement and the source supports the\nnotion that he believed Germany would retain peace. The provenance of the source reveals\nthat if is an adaptation of the statement issued by Chamberlain and Hitler; this first hand\naccount gives validity to it\u2019s content in expressing the truce claims behind the of\nappeasement.\nSource C is useful to historians studying the policy of appeasement as it reveals attitudes of\nopposition towards it the source depicts Hitler as a baby, suggestion he is childish and erratic,\nbeing pacified by a bottle labelled \u2018the Munich Agreement\u2019. This suggest Chamberlain\u2019s policy\nwould only temporarily stop Hitler and that, when the bottle is empty he will continue to do as\nhe pleases. Historians know this to be true as following the proposed reclaiming of the\nSudetenland, Hitler would go on to invade Czechoslovakia. This broke the policy of\nappeasement as Hitler had no claim over the land and took it forcefully. These ideas are\nfurthered by the text \u2018Shh-hh! He\u2019ll be quite now-maybe!\u2019 suggesting to Historians that\nChamberlain know the policy would only be a temporary solution. The provenance reveals\nthis cartoon was published in an American newspaper. At the time America practiced\nisolationism from European affairs, therefore the source is useful to historians as it reveals\nunbiased public opinions, of the time about effectiveness of the policy of appeasement.\n\nResponse:\nThis candidate shows developed evaluation and a good level of contextual knowledge \u2013 the student brings in a lot of knowledge about the events before and after the Munich Agreement \u2013 but also the student demonstrates \u2018extended reasoning relating to utility\u2019 as evidenced by the way that almost every point is brought back to an evaluation of the source, for example, \u201cThis is also useful in revealing public opinions\u201d, \u201cthe source supports the notion that he believed Germany would retain peace\u201d \u201cthis first hand account gives validity to its content\u201d. Both sources are dealt with equally well, demonstrating the \u2018complex evaluation of both sources with sustained judgement\u2019 which is required for level 4. The relationship between the sources could be dealt with in a more explicit way, though it is implied where the student compares the attitude of Hitler and Chamberlain in source B with the opposition in source C. To reach the top of the level, the student could have also included more specific factual detail, such as dates or detail about the Four Powers Conference. Overall, the answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 11 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nSource A is critical of Stalin. How do you know?

The words in the cartoon are spoken by Stalin, the leader of the USSR. Mao, the leader of China, is loading soldiers into the barrel of a gun. The newspaper cartoon, on the opposite page, shows a man, who is using a shovel to put small soldiers into a barrel of a large gun. The man has the name \u2018MAO\u2019 written on the bottom of one of his trouser legs and he is sweating. Behind him stands another man who is watching him while holding a pipe in his hand. The words \u201cAlways Glad To Lend My Neighbour A Shovel\u201d are written at the top of the image.\n\nAnswer:\nSource A is critical of Stalin as it shows soldiers being loaded into \u2018the barrel of the gun.\u2019 This\ndemonstrates that the source believes that Stalin is responsible for the death of the soldiers\ndue to his violent actions and decisions during his time being the leader of the USSR leading\nthe source to present him in a critical way.\nAnother reason why source A is critical of Stalin is due to the fact that Stalin is standing there\nwith a smile on his face while Mao is doing all the work. This could represent the fact that\nStalin made others do all the hard work and suffer while he watched from the side\n\nResponse:\nThe student identifies relevant features of the source, for example \u2018it shows soldiers being loaded in to the barrel of the gun\u2019 and \u2018Stalin is standing there with a smile on his face\u2019. The student then analyses these features and explains what they mean and how they could be seen as critical of Stalin. There is some \u2018simple knowledge\u2019 shown, when they mention \u2018his violent actions and decisions\u2019 but this is not developed with factual detail. Therefore, this answer is level 1. In order to get to level 2, the student would need to add detailed examples or factual knowledge and understanding to provide developed analysis. Overall, this answer falls into level 1 and would be awarded 2 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nSource A is critical of Stalin. How do you know?

The words \u201cAlways Glad To Lend My Neighbour A Shovel\u201d are written at the top of the image.\n\nAnswer:\nSource A is critical of Stalin because it is exposing how he abused his alliance with China. Mao is shovelling his own troops into a barrel of a gun which represents how during the Korean war \u2013 a proxy war in which Stalin and the USSR fuelled \u2013 Stalin used Chinese troops rather than his own. This was a clear moment when the USSR took advantage of their new friendship with China, and it is depicted in the cartoon to expose how Stalin used China. Additionally it is a criticism of how in the Korean war it was mainly Koreans and Chinese soldiers who suffered. This is shown as Stalin is illustrated laughing at Mao, almost acting like a puppeteer.\n\nResponse:\nThe student also identifies relevant features of the source: \u2018Mao is shovelling his own troops into a barrel of a gun\u2019; \u2018Stalin is illustrated laughing at Mao\u2019. They then develop this point with \u2018factual knowledge and understanding\u2019, \u2018Stalin use Chinese troops rather than his own\u2019. They also use the key term \u2018proxy war\u2019 and then focus back on the issue of the question \u2018to expose how Stalin used China\u2019. There is a second developed point, where the student shows knowledge of the Korean War \u2018it was mainly Koreans and Chinese soldiers who suffered\u2019 and then links this to the source \u2018This is shown as\u2026\u2019. Overall, this answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 4 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow useful are Sources B and C to an historian studying the Berlin Blockade?

An historian can see how even though the Blockade did not lead to armed conflict, Sources B and C are evidence that both sides tried to blame each other for the incident. The sources both show how tension increased between East and West during the Berlin Blockade and made future cooperation less likely.\nLevel_3:\n  description: \n    - Developed evaluation of sources based on the content and/or provenance\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 9\n    minimum: 7\n  criteria:\n    - Extended reasoning related to utility on the basis of content and/or provenance\n  progression: \n    - Students may progress from a simple evaluation of the sources with extended reasoning related to utility on the basis of content and/or provenance\n  example_answers:\n    - Source B is useful to show how Stalin tried to justify his actions by accusing the Western powers of acting unreasonably. He is trying to blame the Western powers for breaking the agreement made at the Yalta Conference in 1945, that Germany and Berlin would be kept as four separate sections. However, the Western Allies merged their zones in 1948 and also introduced a single currency into the newly formed West Germany and West Berlin.\n    - Source C is a British cartoon so it will be opposed to Stalin\u2019s blockade of West Berlin. The cartoon makes fun of \u2018Joe\u2019 Stalin because he cannot block the air corridors to stop planes from bringing supplies to Berlin.\n    - Source C is useful to an historian because it shows that British people were pleased to be standing up to Stalin\u2019s Blockade. The Allies began the Berlin Airlift which was a solution to the blockade of land routes to West Berlin. Planes were used to provide essential supplies of food and fuel to the people of West Berlin. The cartoon shows that Stalin wanted to try and stop the planes from flying. However, he did not want to risk shooting them down as that would be seen as an act of war. Source B explains that Stalin\u2019s motive for the blockade was to protect his zone of occupation. When Britain, France and the USA merged their zones into one, Stalin was afraid that Germany would recover and could threaten the USSR once again.\nLevel_2:\n  description: \n    - Simple evaluation of source(s) based on content and/or provenance\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 6\n    minimum: 4\n  criteria:\n    - Simple evaluation of the content and/or provenance\n  progression: \n    - Students may progress from a basic analysis of the source(s) to simple evaluation of the content and/or provenance\n  example_answers:\n    - Source B explains that Stalin\u2019s motive for the blockade was to protect his zone.

The Soviet Government has now been forced to take measures to protect the interests of the German people and the economy of the Soviet zone. We are concerned about the people of Berlin and are trying to solve the problems about essential supplies. If the situation continues we will not hesitate to supply the whole of Berlin by ourselves.\nSource C: A cartoon published in a widely read British newspaper, September 1948. The three figures represent Joseph Stalin, and Soviet politicians. The title, \u2018No Go Joe\u2019, refers to Joseph Stalin. The cartoon, on the opposite page, shows three men standing on each other\u2019s shoulders. Two men, one of them is Stalin, have signs around their necks that read, \u2018RAIL CLOSED\u2019 and \u2018ROAD CLOSED\u2019. The man at the top is holding a large net in his hand and planes can be seen flying overhead. One of the planes is caught in the net. Behind the men, there is a railway barrier and an arrow\u2013shaped sign pointing into the distance towards where the planes are flying. The sign reads \u2018BERLIN\u2019. Under the image are the words \u2018NO GO JOE!\u2019\n\nAnswer:\nI think that source C would be useful to historians. I think this because it is an accurate representation of what happened. Firstly, this source is critical of Stalin because it is drawn and published by the British. On the cartoon, Stalin and the Soviet leaders are stood with \u2018road closed\u2019 and \u2018rail closed\u2019 on a sign around their necks, this is accurate because when Stalin introduced the blockade, he wanted to starve west Berlin of essential supplies so he blocked railway lines and roads. However, as the source shows, the person on top has no sign and the net he is holding is damaged, this effectively shows the lack of control of air transport. This is how the Berlin air lift started and helped the west Berliners get the essentials they needed.\nI also think source B would also be useful to a historian because it is the Soviet government\u2019s actual words that were sent to western governments. This is critical of the western superpowers. The Berlin blockade was caused be an introduction to the new West German currency called the deutchmark. All of the western superpowers joined up their parts of Berlin to help the economy recover faster. The USSR felt threatened by this so they increased the blockade.\n\nResponse:\nThe student shows understanding of both sources, so achieves level 1. This is shown when the student says \u2018it is drawn and published by the British\u2019, \u2018Stalin and Soviet leaders are stood with \u2018road closed\u2019 and \u2018rail closed\u2019 on a sign around their necks\u2019. The student then starts to bring in some contextual knowledge and shows some \u2018simple evaluation\u2019: \u2018This is accurate because when Stalin introduced the blockade, he wanted to starve west Berlin of essential supplies\u2019. This would achieve level 2. The student does not provide the level of detail or \u2018developed evaluation\u2019 that is required for level 3. They would need to include more specific detail and a greater focus on the issue of usefulness, rather than the \u2018accurate\u2019 they use throughout the answer.\nSimilarly, source B demonstrates some simple evaluation, but not developed. There is some knowledge shown about the causes of the Berlin blockade and this is used to support the source \u2018The USSR felt threatened by this so they increased the blockade\u2019, which is level 2, simple evaluation. There is not enough detailed knowledge or \u2018extended reasoning related to utility\u2019 to reach level 3, even though the candidate does address both sources. Overall, this answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 5 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow useful are Sources B and C to an historian studying the Berlin Blockade?

Under the image are the words \u2018NO GO JOE!\u2019\n\nAnswer:\nSource B is useful to some extent because it mentions the agreement made by the Four Powers. This is referring to the Yalta & Potsdam Conferences where Britain, France, the USA & the USSR agreed to divide Germany into four zones. Since Berlin, the capital, lay in the Soviet zone, it would also be divided. Source B is useful because Britain, France & the USA combined their sectors of Germany to form Trizonia, set up a new government, the Bundestag, & introduced a new currency without consulting Stalin. Source B states that measures were taken to protect the economy of the soviet zone & it was written in 1948, the first year of the Berlin Blockade. A mini-blockade occurred at this time to stop the transfer of military supplies. It was written by the Soviet government, who may have been trying to defend their actions of setting up a blockade. Overall, Source B is useful because it indicates that disagreements over Berlin are what caused the blockade.\nSource C is useful because it shows how road & rail links were cut off in the Berlin blockade. Also, energy from power stations in East Germany were cut off. As it was published for the British public it is showing the positives of the Berlin airlift. This occurred from 1948 to 1949 & a one-way system & an air corridor was implemented to prevent crashes, however 79 pilots did die. The planes in the source are seen to be flying from West Germany to West Berlin to counteract the blockade & supply materials. During the Easter Parade, 12,000 tonnes of coal was given to West Berlin. Source C is very convincing because it shows the Truman Doctrine in action through the airlift. Since Berlin was a capitalist city in a communist country, Truman was determined not to let it fall to Communism As it was written, in Britain, it portrays the Soviet politicians in a negative light, however it was because of the Berlin airlift that the blockade was called off in 1948.\nOverall, Source C is the most useful because it presents the success of the airlift.\n\nResponse:\nThe answer moves quickly into level 3, by providing \u2018developed evaluation\u2019 of both sources, showing \u2018extended reasoning\u2019 through detailed knowledge of events and clear understanding of the messages of the sources. In source B, there is an accurate description of how Germany was divided and the formation of Trizonia, which threatened the USSR, and this is linked successfully to the content of the source \u2018source B states that measures were taken to protect the economy of the Soviet zone\u2019 and \u2018overall, Source B is useful because it indicates that disagreements over Berlin are what caused the blockade\u2019. This final sentence of the paragraph shows good focus on the question and secures it into level 3. \nSimilarly, source C is developed with knowledge about how the Blockade worked and the Berlin Airlift. The knowledge is detailed and linked to features of the source, so providing developed evaluation of the content. \u2018road and rail links were cut off\u2019, \u2018The planes in the source are seen to be flying from West Germany to West Berlin\u2019. Specific factual details such as \u201912,000 tonnes of coal was given to West Berlin\u2019, are a good indicator of a level 3 answer. There is also the reference to the key term \u2018Truman Doctrine\u2019 and understanding shown of this.\nTo get to level 4, the answer would need to evaluate the provenance as well as the content of the sources. There is some brief attempt in both sources; \u2018It was written by the Soviet government, who may have been trying to defend their actions\u2019 and \u2018As it was written in Britain, it portrays the Soviet politicians in a negative light\u2019, but these brief references are simple evaluation, not developed, so not enough to secure level 4, which requires \u2018Complex evaluation of both sources\u2026 based on content and provenance\u2019. \nOverall, there is developed evaluation of the content of both sources, so the answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 9 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow useful are Sources B and C to an historian studying the Berlin Blockade?

The three figures represent Joseph Stalin, and Soviet politicians. The title, \u2018No Go Joe\u2019, refers to Joseph Stalin. The cartoon, on the opposite page, shows three men standing on each other\u2019s shoulders. Two men, one of them is Stalin, have signs around their necks that read, \u2018RAIL CLOSED\u2019 and \u2018ROAD CLOSED\u2019. The man at the top is holding a large net in his hand and planes can be seen flying overhead. One of the planes is caught in the net. Behind the men, there is a railway barrier and an arrow\u2013shaped sign pointing into the distance towards where the planes are flying. The sign reads \u2018BERLIN\u2019. Under the image are the words \u2018NO GO JOE!\u2019\n\nAnswer:\nSource B is useful to a historian studying the Berlin Blockade as it shows how USSR said the reasoning behind the Berlin Blockade was because they had no other option. It says soviets were forced to take measures as the America, France and Britain wouldn\u2019t allow the agreement made at the between the powers. This is referring to the Yalta and Potsdam conferences in February and July of 1945 when the powers decided to split Berlin and Germany into 4 so in order to keep it weak after the war. Stalin saying the supporters weren\u2019t following the agreement could be representative of how America, Britain and France joined their sectors together to make East and West Berlin which was a threat to Stalin as it made West Germany stronger. The provenance of this source is also useful to a Historian studying the blockade as it was written by Stalin in 1948 July just a month after he began the blockade in June so the purpose of this letter could have been to justify his actions in Berlin. Stalin paints USSR as the saviours by saying they are concerned about the people further and tries to say that he will help the whole of Berlin which is representative of how he did the blockade in order to force the west to allow him to have control over the whole of berlin.\nSource C is also useful as it represents soviet politicians blocking the way saying \u2018road and rails are closed which is what happened in the blockade, soviet troops blocked of all road and rail access to Berlin, The signpost for Berlin represents how it was access to Berlin that was cut of Source C is also useful as it shows planes flying in the direction of Berlin which represents the airlift that the west started to get supplies to blocked off Berlin. It also shows Stalin in top of both soldiers with a net representing how he was desperately trying to stop the airlift in order to gain control of West Germany. The provenance of this source is also useful as it was written in 1948 at this point the airlift was well underway and the west were successfully supplying west Berlin and determined to carry on doing so in order to prevent West Berlin falling to communism which would be a failure of the Truman Doctrine. It was also published in a British newspaper which is useful as it shows the Wests views on Stalin as he is presented as a ridiculous and idiotic figure as it would not be possible to stop the airlift with a net so the cartoon is ridiculing Stalin. It was also written in the middle of the airlift and supports the west which represents how they needed the support of the people of the west in order to carry on the airlift.\nIn conclusion I believe all sources are useful for a historian studying the blockade. B represents Soviets reasoning behind the blockade and C represents the west\u2019s view of Stalin and of the blockade.\n\nResponse:\nThe student achieves developed evaluation of both sources, by clearly referencing features of the content of the sources and then demonstrating a good range of accurate factual knowledge to evaluate them. The student then evaluates the provenance in a developed way, picking up different aspects of the provenance, for example, the author, the date and the purpose of the source and then evaluating how that might affect the source\u2019s usefulness, for example, \u2018so the purpose of this letter could have been to justify his actions in Berlin\u2019.\nThis formula is repeated for source C, with the student first evaluating the content, showing good contextual knowledge and then evaluating several aspects of the provenance \u2013 the date and the fact it was published in a British newspaper. Again, level 3 is achieved by not just identifying who made the source but then explaining how that affects utility, for example \u2018it was also published in a British newspaper which is useful as it shown the West\u2019s views on Stalin\u2019.\nThe answer concludes with a short overall judgement, which recognises that both sources are useful to show different aspects of the blockade. This satisfies the \u2018sustained judgement\u2019 part of level 4 criteria, topping off the \u2018complex evaluation of both sources based on content and provenance\u2019. Overall, this answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 12 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nSource A is critical of the events as Kent Sate University. How do you know?

The National Guard soldier on the left is speaking to the figure on the right who represents America.\n\nAnswer:\nSource A depicts the events at Kent State University, in which students were killed in an anti-Vietnam war protest. It shows the feelings of the American public at this stage, disappointed. It is critical because it shows the gun smoking, highlighting its use, and the caption below shows the cartoonists criticism of the use of excessive force.\n\nResponse:\nThe student shows factual knowledge of the events \u2018in which students were killed in an anti-Vietnam war protest\u2019, and understanding of the meaning of the source \u2018disappointed feelings of the American public at this stage\u2019. They then explicitly explain why it is critical, highlighting the smoking gun and the use of excessive force, completing the developed analysis. Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be given 4 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nStudy Source B and C in the Source Booklet. How useful are Sources B and C to a historian studying the Korean War.

Through United Nations \u2013 Peace!\u2019\n\nAnswer:\nSource B is useful to a historian studying the Korean War because it shows the USSR\u2019s involvement in the war and how they sided with North Korea. This was a confidential message which is useful because it shows how Stalin didn\u2019t want the USA to know that he was working with the communist side as it would create another conflict directly between the USA and the USSR. It also tells us what he supplied to North Korea. He supplied ammunition and equipment but didn\u2019t send troops. This was also 6 months before the North had invaded the South which shows he didn\u2019t realise how the war would go and how big it would get. Source C is useful for a historian studying the Korean War as it shows the Republic of Korea struggling on the floor, helpless, with a much larger man representing the communist aggressors ready to attack him. However, a large hand representing the UN is reaching out to grab him to Save the South Koreans. This is referring to how the UN stepped in on South Korea\u2019s side to contain communism and all the countries that made up the UN are charging from the outside to present the support given against the countries like North Korea, USSR and China. It was a US poster which shows how they thought the communists were \u2018criminal\u2019 and were using this as propaganda to make people in agreement of the UN\u2019s involvement in the war.\n\nResponse:\nThe student shows understanding of both sources and includes some accurate factual knowledge, for example saying \u2018this was also 6 months before the North had invaded the South\u2019 and \u2018he supplied ammunition and equipment but didn\u2019t send troops.\u2019 The provenance and content are both analysed and there is some attempt to evaluate \u2018this was a confidential message which is useful because\u2026\u2019 but this is not developed, or used consistently through the answer. Evaluation and links to utility are more often implied rather than clearly explained, using phrases such as \u2018which shows\u2019 or \u2018this is referring to\u2019, rather than explaining how this would be useful to an historian. This implied evaluation is level 2 \u2013 simple evaluation, even though both sources are addressed and there are references to both content and provenance. \nTo reach level 3, the student would need to include \u2018extended reasoning related to utility\u2019 and a greater amount of factual knowledge to support this.\nOverall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 6 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nStudy Source B and C in the Source Booklet.

The text to the side of the image says \u201853 United Nations condemn the criminal Communist invasion of the Republic of Korea! The Communist warmakers will be stopped! Through United Nations \u2013 Peace!\u2019\n\nAnswer:\nSource B is useful to a Historian as it first of all shows the USSR relations with North Korea and how exactly they helped. It states how he would provide \u2018resources\u2019 and any \u2018other ammunition and equipment\u2019 alongside any assistance of soviet specialists if needed. It shows to historians that the USSR provided resources but never directly got involved with the Korean War. Since the source us a confidential message sent by Stalin to Shtykov, a secret ambassador to North Korea, it is a trustworthy and useful source, as it was private, not to be released, message. Stalin\u2019s two intentions and works are shown here. Therefore source B is useful, it is able to show the USSR relations with North Korea and is a confidential message, so has provenance.\nSource C is useful to a Historian studying the Korean War as it is able to show how much the USA wanted to stop communism spreading to Korea. The headline \u2018criminal\u2019, showcases how the US thinks communism is a crime, backed up by \u2018criminal communist invasions\u2019, how it is pure evil. The poster also has illustrations of a hand (the UN) coming to grab a man (the\ncommunist aggressors), who are beating down the Republic of Korea, even drawing blood. This illustration symbolises that the UN has now come to an intervene, because of the Truman Doctrine meaning that they are able to intervene and help countries in need from communism. The UN is going to \u2018grab\u2019 the people that decide to make the Republic of Korea communist, is what the poster essentially says. There\u2019s also people running forward holding flags, and the text \u201953 United Nations condemn\u2019, symbolising how they to should and are going to come forward and get rid of the communist aggressors. Finally, the text \u2018Through United Nations \u2013 peace\u2019 shows how the UN are doing this for peace.\nTherefore source B and C are useful to Historians studying the Korean war as they are able to see the USSR\u2019s exact relations, and relationships, with communist North Korea. Also, they are able to see the inherent threat USA has to stop communism spreading to Korea.\n\nResponse:\nThe student shows understanding of the content of source B, bringing in some simple knowledge \u2018the USSR provided resources but never directly got involved\u2019 and evaluates the provenance well, explaining that \u2018since the source is a confidential message\u2026.it is a trustworthy and useful source, as it was private, not to be released, message\u2019. This developed evaluation opens up the possibility of level 3, depending on whether source C is addressed. \nFor source C, they focus more on the content of the source, and describe the source, explaining its meaning, which is the basic analysis required for level 1. There is some simple evaluation \u2018it is able to show how much the USA wanted to stop communism spreading to Korea\u2019 but most of the paragraph is analysis, describing features of the source and explaining what they mean. Paragraph 2 falls into level 2. To get to level 3 there would need to be a greater focus on evaluation rather than analysis, either of the content or provenance, which isn\u2019t mentioned for source C.\nOverall, this answer falls into level 3, due to the level 3 developed evaluation in the first paragraph, but would be awarded 8 marks, as the second paragraph is not developed.\n\nQuestion:\nStudy Source B and C in the Source Booklet.

Shtykov was the main Soviet expert in Korean affairs. He became the first Soviet ambassador to North Korea in 1948 and shared Kim Il Sung\u2019s wish to unify Korea.\nSource C: A poster published in 1950 by the US Government after the UN agreement\nregarding Korea. The poster, on the opposite page, shows a man in uniform, who is holding a club with spikes on and wearing a top with the words \u2018COMMUNIST AGGRESSORS\u2019 on. In front of him is a person lying on the ground, who is bleeding. The words\u2018Republic of Korea\u2019 are underneath the person. Behind the man with the club, is a large hand with the letters \u2018U.N.\u2019 written on it. The hand is open and facing towards the man. Many smaller people, all holding different flags, can be seen surrounding the man. At the top of the poster it says \u2018STOP! CRIMINAL!\u2019. The text to the side of the image says \u201853 United Nations condemn the criminal Communist invasion of the Republic of Korea! The Communist warmakers will be stopped! Through United Nations \u2013 Peace!\u2019\n\nAnswer:\nSource B is very useful to a historian studying the Korean War because it says \u2018I am ready to help him\u2019. At this time North Korea kept asking for Stalin\u2019s permission to invade the south. However, up until June 1950, Stalin refused because he wanted to have sufficient military equipment and develop nuclear weapons. This means that the source is useful as it shows that Stalin was getting ready to help North Vietnam which led to the Korean War. Also the source is a confidential message, hence it is useful as Stalin had no reason to not tell the truth. This is useful to a historian as it shows the true cause leading up to the Korean War.\nSource C is quite useful to a historian as it shows a big and evil looking communist aggressor attacking the Republic of Korea. It then has the UN trying to stop the communist. At this time, the UN passed resolution 84 which was the agreement to support Korea. This was mainly caused by US persuasion at the UN because the USSR had been boycotting the UN at this time. This means that the US government were trying to gain the public\u2019s support in America and make communism look like an issue regarding them. Therefore, this source is useful to a historian studying the Korean War as it shows why the US wanted to intervene and how they tried to gain public support.\nOverall the sources are most useful as a pair. This is because source B gives background information on how the USSR would get involved in the Korean War. Whereas source C gives information for why the US wanted to get involved. Therefore, together they present a well rounded idea for the beginning of the Korean War\n\nResponse:\nThe student approaches the answer in a methodical fashion, starting by analysing the sources, showing what they show or say, then bringing in some factual knowledge to put them into context. For source B they say \u2018At this time North Korea kept asking for Stalin\u2019s permission\u2026.\u2019, for source C, they talk about resolution 84 of the UN. The focus on utility is explicit in both paragraphs, \u2018This means that the source is useful as it shows\u2026\u2019 \u2018Therefore, this source is useful\u2026.\u2019. The student also addresses the provenance of both sources. For source B they evaluate the fact that it is a confidential message \u2018hence it is useful as Stalin had no reason not to tell the truth\u2019, and for source C they evaluate the purpose \u2018the US government were trying to gain the public\u2019s support in America\u2026. Therefore, this source is useful\u2026.\u2019. The developed evaluation and extended reasoning based on content and provenance for both sources, places this answer into level 4.\nIn the final paragraph, the candidate attempts to evaluate the two sources together, another level 4 indicator \u2018evaluate the relationship between the sources\u2019. This isn\u2019t complex enough to reach the top of the level but secures the level 4.\nOverall, the answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 11 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nSource A is critical of President Bush.

Former American President, George W Bush, is signing copies of his memoirs. The figure on the right is President Barack Obama who took over from Bush as President in 2009.\nThe book covers Bush\u2019s time as President including the invasion of Iraq, and his \u2018Mission Accomplished\u2019 speech.\n\nAnswer:\nSource A is made to look critical of George Bush as it shows Barack Obama saying \u2018can you sign it\u2019 \u2018to barrack sorry about the mess I left you\u2019. This shows an indirect dig at George bush\u2019s leadership and country managing skills. This is also backed up by the visual evidence known to man. The invasion of Iraq created many problems for Mr Bush and the American government. Creating many to hate on the US. This then lead to many terrorist attacks in response to the unrightfully tyrany.\n\nResponse:\nThe student identifies a relevant feature of the source \u2013 Obama asking Bush to sign his copy \u2013 and explains what this means \u2013 \u2018an indirect dig at Bush\u2019s leadership and managing skills\u2019. They bring in some simple factual knowledge to support \u2018this is backed up by\u2026\u2019 this is quite simplistic though \u2018creating many to hate on the US\u2019. To get to level 2 there would need to be a greater focus on why the source is critical and some more specific factual knowledge to support it. Overall, the answer falls into level 1 and should be awarded 2 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nSource A is critical of President Bush. How do you know? Explain your answer using Source A and your contextual knowledge.\n\nMark Scheme:\nLevel_2:\n  description: \n    - Developed analysis of source based on content and/or provenance\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 4\n    minimum: 3\n  criteria:\n    - Extended reasoning supported by factual knowledge and understanding related to the features of the source\n  progression: \n    - Students may progress from a simple analysis of the source with extended reasoning supported by factual knowledge and understanding related to the features of the source\n  example_answers: \n    - The cartoon was produced when a new President had taken over and so will criticise the previous one for his mistakes. It suggests that Bush\u2019s memoirs might avoid issues about the real problems facing Iraq. Iraq was suffering from many civilian deaths due to the continuing Insurgency and a refugee crisis.\nLevel_1:\n  description: \n    - Simple analysis of source based on content and/or provenance\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 2\n    minimum: 1\n  criteria:\n    - Identify relevant features in the source and support them with simple factual knowledge and understanding\n  example_answers: \n    - The cartoon shows that Obama\u2019s view that Bush had left Iraq in a \u2018mess\u2019 and the image makes fun of him holding a crayon and not remembering things as they really were.\n\nContext:\nSource A: A cartoon published on an American news website in 2010. Former American President, George W Bush, is signing copies of his memoirs. The figure on the right is President Barack Obama who took over from Bush as President in 2009.\nThe book covers Bush\u2019s time as President including the invasion of Iraq, and his \u2018Mission Accomplished\u2019 speech.\n\nAnswer:\nIn the text Obama asks Bush to write \u2018sorry about the mess I left you\u2019 referencing the multiple shortcomings of his presidency. Bush was criticised for a huge scandal in the days following 9/11 which planted false evidence that made it appear as Saddam Hussein. A forged dossier pointed to Saddam possessing nuclear weapons, which he\u2019d agreed to not own in the 1991 peace treaty. Bush then used the forged evidence in his dossier to reignite conflict in Iraq. The conflict in Iraq. The public dossier was fake. The second Gulf War made many middle-eastern people very angry at the west, causing a sharp spike in the size of terrorist groups. Due to this, Obama was left a nation of angered people and a growing terrorist threat.\n\nResponse:\nThe student identifies a relevant feature of the source \u2013 Obama asking Bush to sign his copy \u2013 and explains what this is a reference to. There is \u2018extended reasoning\u2019 supported by factual knowledge about Bush\u2019s shortcomings as President and the \u2018mess\u2019 that he had left for Obama. There could be stronger focus on the issue of how it is critical of Bush, but this is addressed in the second sentence \u2018Bush was criticised for a huge scandal\u2019 and the depth of knowledge used to substantiate this places this answer into level 2. Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 4 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow useful are Sources B and C to an historian studying the 11 September attacks on the\nUnited States?

President Bush has been careful not to strike first and only think about it afterwards.\nThe United Nations Security Council has passed a resolution to combat terrorism and now we need to think about how to fight terrorists. We have to stop their training, funding and supply of weapons. We will do whatever is necessary'.\n\nAnswer:\nAfter the 9/11 attacks America sent thousand of soldiers into middle-eastern countries to try and eradicate terrorism, This sudden response was prompted by the 9/11 attacks. Sources A depicts a rat labelled as \u2018Terrorism\u2019 retreating from a large muscular figure in the hat often depicted on \u2018Uncle Sam\u2019, a figure used in many World War 2 posters. Uncle Sam is meant to represent America as a whole. Terrorists were often referred to as \u2018rats\u2019 by many people so the use of one makes terrorists seem weak and cowardly, a view shared by many at the time, Another common viewpoint to this day is that America is a giant,both economically and in in terms of military might. This personification of these views makes America look for stronger than terrorists, a common mindset of the people at the time. The cartoon would show a historian the American mindset at the time.\nThe speech by British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is useful to historians as it shows British support of American and global due to the UN\u2019s new resolution. A global resolution against terrorism, created by the most powerful nations at the time showed how the world responded to terrorism with quick and decisive moves. The speech also strongly supports Bush as Blair claims that Bush is careful to \u2018not strike first\u2019, making it appear that America wasn\u2019t interested in conflict. This makes America look good as it implies they don\u2019t want a war where countless would die, allowing 100% of the blame to be place on terrorism. A historian would be able to understand that terrorism was recognised as a global threat that was being taken very seriously.\n\nResponse:\nThe student quickly shows understanding of both sources, and develops their analysis by identifying and explaining the meaning of several features of each. There is some evaluation of utility in both paragraphs: in paragraph 1 \u2018the cartoon would show a historian the American mindset at the time\u2019 and in paragraph 2 \u2018The speech\u2026 is useful to historians as it shows\u2026\u2019, \u2018A historian would be able to understand that terrorism was recognised as a global threat\u2019.  There is very little mention of the provenance of the sources and this isn\u2019t related to utility, so the answer will not fall into level 4. However, there is some developed evaluation of the content of both, so level 3 does apply. In both sources, the evaluation could be developed further with more factual knowledge and a more consistent focus on utility. Therefore, overall, the answer falls into level 3 and should be awarded 8 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nHow useful are Sources B and C to an historian studying the 11 September attacks on the\nUnited States?

We have to stop their training, funding and supply of weapons. We will do whatever is necessary'.\n\nAnswer:\nBoth sources are useful to a certain extent as they show that after 9/11 attacks, American foreign policy shifted slightly to the combatting of terrorism and revenge for this attack upon the American people.\nThe American cartoon presents the United States a big, muscly character, providing comfort to the American people that President Bush\u2019s government is willing to go to great lengths for revenge from the 9/11 attacks. Terrorism is presented as a rat which shows that it is feeble and able to be defeated by the American government. This is useful to a historian because it was published in September 2001after the 9/11 attacks showing the plans for the \u2018war on terror\u2019 and how the United States are following the terrorism in Afghanistan where Al-Qaeda were believed to be rising.\nTony Blair\u2019s speech shows how it wasn\u2019t just America that was inciting revenge onto global terrorism. This was becoming a global crusade. The UN Security Council allowed America to use defence to protect and defend themselves after 9/11 attacks. This was followed by Operation Enduring Freedom which aimed to get revenge for the attacks. This is useful to a historian as it shows that the UK were supportive of whatever the US put out as their plan and aims to top the growth and development of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda \u2018training, funding and supply of weapons.\u2019\nBoth sources are useful to a historian to a certain extent as it shows the preface and planning of the war on terror. It also shows that the public opinion was sympathetic towards America and many countries (such as the UK) supported Americas plans to invade Afghanistan after 9/11. It is also useful because it shows that the US and UK were willing to go to any lengths necessary to get revenge for the attacks and to reduce global terrorism around the globe by neutralising the threats posed by Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and other terrorist organisation.\n\nResponse:\nThere is a clear attempt in the answer to consider the relationship between the sources, both at the start and end, which is one of the criteria for level 4. However, the content and provenance of both sources needs to be evaluated in a developed way for this to be relevant.\nIn the second paragraph, the student identifies relevant features of the content of source B and explains the meaning of the cartoon. In the second half of the paragraph, they provide evaluation of the provenance \u2018it was published in September 2001 after the 9/11 attacks\u2019 and the content \u2018showing the plans for the war on terror and how the US are following the terrorism\u2026\u2019. There is some factual knowledge used to develop this, with the mention of Afghanistan and Al-Qaeda.\nIn the third paragraph, the student evaluates source C, explaining its meaning and using factual knowledge to develop this further, with the mention of the UN Security Council and Operation Enduring Freedom. There is clear evaluation of the content with \u2018this is useful to an historian\u2026\u2019. The evaluation of the provenance is weaker here, though it is implied with the mention of the source being a speech by Tony Blair. \nThe final paragraph develops the evaluation further, treating both sources together, though again the evaluation of content is stronger that that of provenance. However, both the content and provenance of both sources are evaluated, even if it isn\u2019t consistently developed.\nOverall, the answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 11 marks.\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nMark Scheme:\n{mark_scheme}\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nAnswer:\n{answer}\n\nResponse:",
