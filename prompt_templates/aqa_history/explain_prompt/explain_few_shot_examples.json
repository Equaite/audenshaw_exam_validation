However, there is enough for level 2. The student has addressed both the content of the source and the provenance briefly (talking about the nature of the source and evaluating this in a simple way).

However, the evaluation of the provenance is stronger here, showing some extended reasoning, evidenced by the point about American attitudes and why the source was made \u2013 therefore making it useful to show attitudes to appeasement.
