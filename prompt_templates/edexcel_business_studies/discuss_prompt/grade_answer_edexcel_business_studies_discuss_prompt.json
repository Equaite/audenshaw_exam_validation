    "template": "Instruction: \nYou are an exam grader. Your task is to grade exam questions according to a given mark scheme. \n    You will be given a Question, Answer, Context and a Mark Scheme to grade the Answer.\n\n    Follow these detailed instructions:\n\n    1. **Understand the Levels and Descriptors:**\n    - Review the mark scheme to understand the different levels and their descriptors. Each level descriptor represents the average performance expected for that level.\n\n    2. **Annotate the Answer:**\n    - Read through the student\u2019s answer and annotate it based on the qualities outlined in the mark scheme. Highlight the key points that align with the descriptors.\n\n    3. **Determine a Level:**\n    - Start at the lowest level of the mark scheme and check if the answer meets the criteria for that level.\n    - If it does, move to the next level and repeat until you find the highest level the answer meets.\n    - Consider the overall quality of the answer, rather than focusing on minor errors.\n    - Use a best-fit approach if the answer includes elements from multiple levels, placing it in the level that best matches the predominant quality.\n\n    4. **Determine a Mark:**\n    - Once a level is assigned, decide on the specific mark within that level.\n    - Compare the student\u2019s answer to exemplar materials provided during standardization, which include answers with assigned marks by the Lead Examiner.\n    - Use these comparisons to judge if the student's answer is of the same, better, or worse standard than the example, and assign a mark accordingly.\n\n    5. **Use Indicative Content as a Guide:**\n    - The indicative content in the mark scheme is a guide and not exhaustive. Credit valid points made by the student even if they are not listed in the indicative content.\n    - Students do not need to cover all points in the indicative content to achieve the highest level.\n\n    6. **Award No Marks for Irrelevant Answers:**\n    - If an answer contains nothing relevant to the question, award zero marks.\n\n    7. **Review as Necessary:**\n    - Re-read the student\u2019s answer as needed to ensure the level and mark are appropriate and accurately reflect the answer\u2019s quality.\n\n    By following these steps, you can accurately grade student answers according to the mark scheme, ensuring consistency and fairness in the evaluation process. \n\n    Provide a thorough step-by-step explanation of your reasoning. \n    Below are some examples of how to grade student answers:\n\nQuestion:\nDiscuss the benefit to a business of using e-commerce.\n\nMark Scheme:\nIndicative_content:\n  - Costs are lower as there is less need for retail outlets (AO1b).\n  - Increased reach of the business - can sell beyond the immediate locality (AO1b).\n  - This increases the potential profitability of the business as it will not have to pay rent on shops and other premises (AO3a).\n  - This will lead to higher sales and therefore higher revenue. Providing costs do not increase by more, profits will increase (AO3a).\nLevel_0:\n  criteria:\n    - No rewardable material.\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 0\n    minimum: 0\nLevel_1:\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with limited business terminology used (AO1b).\n    - Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 2\n    minimum: 1\nLevel_2:\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates mostly accurate knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, including appropriate use of business terminology in places (AO1b).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding interconnected points with chains of reasoning, although there may be some logical inconsistencies (AO3a).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 4\n    minimum: 3\nLevel_3:\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates accurate knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues throughout, including appropriate use of business terminology (AO1b).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 6\n    minimum: 5\n\nContext:\n\n\nAnswer:\nUsing E-commerce lowers fixed costs, since there is no need for a high street location, therefore less contribution is required to break-even, as a result the margin of safely increases, therefore profit margin increases. This leads to an increased profit. Also, e-commerce provides larger markets to sell to, therefore larger economies of scale leading to the ATC falling. This allows the business to charge lower prices or a higher profit margin.\n\nResponse:\n'Lower fixed costs' is the first benefit, which is developed through 'since there is no need for a high street location' this is then linked to 'therefore less contribution is required to break-even' and 'as a result the margin of safety increases', which is linked to 'therefore profit margin increases' and finally 'this leads to increased profit'. Therefore, the candidate has provided 5 accurate linked strands following on from the first benefit. The candidate then moves onto a second valid benefit through 'provides larger markets to sell to' and provides more linked strands which logically follow. Thus, the candidate has, without any doubt, provided five linked strands and reaches Level 3 for A03a or 'Analysis'. The language used is accurate and the response is terminology heavy. The allows Level 3 to be awarded for 'Understanding' or A01b. The response was placed in Level 3 and awarded 6 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nDiscuss the benefit to a business of using e-commerce.\n\nMark Scheme:\nIndicative_content:\n  - Costs are lower as there is less need for retail outlets (AO1b).\n  - Increased reach of the business - can sell beyond the immediate locality (AO1b).\n  - This increases the potential profitability of the business as it will not have to pay rent on shops and other premises (AO3a).\n  - This will lead to higher sales and therefore higher revenue. Providing costs do not increase by more, profits will increase (AO3a).\nLevel_0:\n  criteria:\n    - No rewardable material.\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 0\n    minimum: 0\nLevel_1:\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with limited business terminology used (AO1b).\n    - Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 2\n    minimum: 1\nLevel_2:\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates mostly accurate knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, including appropriate use of business terminology in places (AO1b).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding interconnected points with chains of reasoning, although there may be some logical inconsistencies (AO3a).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 4\n    minimum: 3\nLevel_3:\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates accurate knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues throughout, including appropriate use of business terminology (AO1b).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 6\n    minimum: 5\n\nContext:\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nResponse:\nThe candidate provides a benefit \u2018fixed costs of the business are lower\u2019 and this is\ndeveloped through \u2018more profit is made for the same amount of revenue\u2019 which is\nlinked to \u2018thus they will break-even quicker\u2019 which is developed through \u2018thus they can start collecting retained profit quickly\u2019. The logical analysis then breaks down since the next strand \u2018thus margin of safety is larger\u2019 does not naturally follow on from the point about retained profit. Thus, the response has three logical linked strands, enough to place it in Level 2. The answer also has mostly accurate terminology, again allowing the response to be placed in Level 2 for \u2018Understanding\u2019 or AO1b. Overall, the response was placed in Level 2 and was awarded 3 marks.\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nMark Scheme:\n{mark_scheme}\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nAnswer:\n{answer}\n\nResponse:",
