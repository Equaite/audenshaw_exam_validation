    "template": "Instruction: \nYou are an exam grader. Your task is to grade exam questions according to a given mark scheme. \n    You will be given a Question, Answer, Context and a Mark Scheme to grade the Answer.\n\n    Follow these detailed instructions:\n\n    1. **Understand the Levels and Descriptors:**\n    - Review the mark scheme to understand the different levels and their descriptors. Each level descriptor represents the average performance expected for that level.\n\n    2. **Annotate the Answer:**\n    - Read through the student\u2019s answer and annotate it based on the qualities outlined in the mark scheme. Highlight the key points that align with the descriptors.\n\n    3. **Determine a Level:**\n    - Start at the lowest level of the mark scheme and check if the answer meets the criteria for that level.\n    - If it does, move to the next level and repeat until you find the highest level the answer meets.\n    - Consider the overall quality of the answer, rather than focusing on minor errors.\n    - Use a best-fit approach if the answer includes elements from multiple levels, placing it in the level that best matches the predominant quality.\n\n    4. **Determine a Mark:**\n    - Once a level is assigned, decide on the specific mark within that level.\n    - Compare the student\u2019s answer to exemplar materials provided during standardization, which include answers with assigned marks by the Lead Examiner.\n    - Use these comparisons to judge if the student's answer is of the same, better, or worse standard than the example, and assign a mark accordingly.\n\n    5. **Use Indicative Content as a Guide:**\n    - The indicative content in the mark scheme is a guide and not exhaustive. Credit valid points made by the student even if they are not listed in the indicative content.\n    - Students do not need to cover all points in the indicative content to achieve the highest level.\n\n    6. **Award No Marks for Irrelevant Answers:**\n    - If an answer contains nothing relevant to the question, award zero marks.\n\n    7. **Review as Necessary:**\n    - Re-read the student\u2019s answer as needed to ensure the level and mark are appropriate and accurately reflect the answer\u2019s quality.\n\n    By following these steps, you can accurately grade student answers according to the mark scheme, ensuring consistency and fairness in the evaluation process. \n\n    Provide a thorough step-by-step explanation of your reasoning. \n    Below are some examples of how to grade student answers:\n\nQuestion:\nEvaluate whether crowdfunding is an effective source of finance for Good and\nProper Tea. You should use the information provided as well as your knowledge of \nbusiness.\n\nMark Scheme:\nIndicative_content:\n  - Crowd funding is an effective source of finance because it means that finance can be raised without any repayments being required, as would be the case if Emilie were to choose a bank loan (AO1b).\n  - There are a wide range of sources of finance that are appropriate for Good and Proper Tea, including bank loans and share issue (AO1b).\n  - As Good and Proper Tea is a new business it will require finance to expand and grow. Crowd funding can be highly effective for such a business as it can keep fixed costs to a minimum (AO2).\n  - Crowd funding can help to raise the profile of Good and Proper Tea, in addition to raising the finance. With 372 investors, these individuals will play an important part in promoting the business (AO2).\n  - As a relatively new start-up, Good and Proper Tea needs to keep costs as low as possible in the short term so it can establish itself in the market. Crowd funding is an effective way of doing this as the people taking the risk are the investors (AO3a).\n  - As Good and Proper Tea is a new business, with a number of competitors, such promotion will be useful (AO3a).\n  - However, crowd funding does mean that the profits of Good and Proper Tea will need to be shared with the investors. As the business had 372 backers, this will mean that the profits Emilie earns will be shared between a larger number of people (AO3b).\n  - However, whether crowd funding is the best source of finance depends on the objectives of Emilie. The 372 investors have only risked their stake, for some as low as \u00a31, and they are unlikely to be experts in the market (AO3b).\n\nLevel_0:\n  criteria:\n    - No rewardable material.\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 0\n    minimum: 0\n\nLevel_1:\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with limited business terminology used (AO1b).\n    - Limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2).\n    - Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).\n    - Draws a conclusion, supported by generic assertions from limited evaluation of business information and issues (AO3b).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 4\n    minimum: 1\n\nLevel_2:\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates mostly accurate knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, including appropriate use of business terminology in places (AO1b).\n    - Sound application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context although there may be some inconsistencies (AO2).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding interconnected points with chains of reasoning, although there may be some logical inconsistencies (AO3a).\n    - Draws a conclusion based on sound evaluation of business information and issues (AO3b).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 8\n    minimum: 5\n\nLevel_3:\n  criteria:\n    - Demonstrates accurate knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues throughout, including appropriate use of business terminology (AO1b).\n    - Detailed application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context throughout (AO2).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a).\n    - Draws a valid and well-reasoned conclusion based on a thorough evaluation of business information and issues (AO3b).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 12\n    minimum: 9\n\nContext:\nGood and Proper Tea was founded in 2012 by Emilie Holmes.\nThe business website states:\n\u2018We source our teas from around the world, from Kenya to India,\nJapan to China and many more places in between. It is important\nto us that we know exactly where each tea comes from and who is\nresponsible for harvesting the leaves we buy. We will always share\nthis information with our customers\u2019.\nThe business started when Emilie\nconverted an old Citro\u00ebn van (pictured\nright) into a mobile brew bar. Emilie\nwanted to expand the business.\nTo achieve this she needed finance.\nShe decided to raise finance using\ncrowdfunding through the Kickstarter\nwebsite. 372 individual backers each\nprovided between \u00a31 and \u00a31000. Good\nand Proper Tea was launched. The first\ncup of tea was brewed and sold in\nShoreditch, London, in 2012.\nThe success of the mobile business led Emilie to plan to open a shop selling the same\nhigh-quality teas. Once again she decided to use crowdfunding as her source of finance.\nThis time, using the Crowdcube website, she successfully raised \u00a3140,000. The shop was\nopened in 2016 and is very successful.\nAs Good and Proper Tea imports its most important ingredient, it is affected by changes\nin the exchange rate. Recent changes in the value of the pound mean that its costs have\nincreased.\n\nAnswer:\nCrowdfunding is when business to a source of     finance in which business\u2019 ask for money online\nto launch a new idea in return for a reward      eg. shares in the company. Crowdfunding is effective for Good and Proper Tea because it allows them to raise a lot of interest free capital, this allows them to expand their hot beverage selling business without using retained profit, therefore it can use that to further expand its business, for example they could open more shops that sell their cups of tea. This would  have more sales, therefore more revenue would be generated, therefore Emilie Holmes business will reach its break-even point faster therefore generating more profit. However, in order to crowd fund you may have to give away shares, this decrease Emilie\u2019s ownership of the business which could lead to her losing control of her business. which could lead to her losing control of her business. In conclusion crowdfunding is good if the idea is innovative and the public are willing to fund it.\n\nResponse:\n5 marks.\nThe candidate starts off with a definition of crowdfunding which is accurate. In the\nsecond paragraph, the candidate starts to develop the rationale behind why\ncrowdfunding is an effective way to raise capital through \u2018interest free\u2019 and \u2018expand their\nhot beverage selling business without using retained profit\u2019 and \u2018therefore it can further\nexpand\u2019. At this point the candidate starts to drift off the question and starts to answer\na question about the benefits of expansion. Nevertheless, sufficient linked strands have\nbeen generated to allow the response to reach Level 2 for Analysis or AO3a. The\nevaluation is contained in both paragraphs 3 and 4 and involves simple statements\ngenerating an overall score in Level 1. Application is primarily confined to the middle\nparagraph with the word \u2018Emilie\u2019 appearing in paragraph 3. This skill was awarded L1/2.\nRegarding understanding or AO1b, the candidate uses terminology well throughout the\nresponse and it is accurate, but because the candidate drifted off the question, Level 2\nwas awarded for this skill.\nOverall, the response was placed in Level 2 and 5 marks were awarded.\n\nQuestion:\nEvaluate whether crowdfunding is an effective source of finance for Good and\nProper Tea.

The shop was\nopened in 2016 and is very successful.\nAs Good and Proper Tea imports its most important ingredient, it is affected by changes\nin the exchange rate. Recent changes in the value of the pound mean that its costs have\nincreased.\n\nAnswer:\nCrowdfunding is where businesses use online crowdfunding websites to ask investors to invest in their business in exchange for shares, discounted products or access to event/exclusive offers. \n\nA benefit to Good and proper tea of using crowdfunding is that it allows their business to grow. This is because they can obtain the finance needed to expand such as opening their shop to sell high quality tea. Therefore they can attract more consumers interested in buying tea sourced from countries such as Kenya. This is because the citizens based in Shoreditch, London is limited in its ability to stock and sell a wide range of tea. As a result sales of Japanese and other teas will increase with finance from crowdfunding. Therefore the revenue brought in from selling high quality tea will increase.\n\nHowever, crowdfunding can be unreliable as it relies on the continued interest and support of investors. As a result good and proper tea will have a increased risk attached to ventures such as opening a second shop outside of London to sell its high quality international tea. Therefore Good nad Proper tea may not always be able to expand its tea sales as it may wish to due to a short fall in investments. In conclusion, it depends whether Googd and Proper tea has enough support for its individual and innovatibe methods such as selling tea out of a van or investments from crowdfunding websites to continue, and that investors are satisfied with the success of the business. Only then can they continue to use crowdfunding as a long tem source of finance.\n\nResponse:\n6 marks.\nThe candidate structures their response using three paragraphs. In the first paragraph, they\nconsider the benefits of crowdfunding, but in only a limited way. Much of this first paragraph\ndoes not deal with the effectiveness of crowdfunding itself, but instead with the benefits of\nGood and Proper Tea growing. There is some Application (AO2) in this paragraph, with\nreference to \u2018consumers interested in buying teas sourced from (different countries)\u2019. The\nsecond paragraph offers some balance, but in a simple way, by considering the possible\ndrawbacks of crowdfunding. This Evaluation (AO3b) is then developed by a final conclusion.\nHowever, this conclusion offers only simple insights and is based on a rather limited evaluation\nof the information.\nOverall, the response was found to be placed in Level 2.\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nMark Scheme:\n{mark_scheme}\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nAnswer:\n{answer}\n\nResponse:",
