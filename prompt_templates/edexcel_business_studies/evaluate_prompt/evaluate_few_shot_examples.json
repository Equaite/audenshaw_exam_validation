Crowdfunding is effective for Good and Proper Tea because it allows them to raise a lot of interest free capital, this allows them to expand their hot beverage selling business without using retained profit, therefore it can use that to further expand its business, for example they could open more shops that sell their cups of tea. This would  have more sales, therefore more revenue would be generated, therefore Emilie Holmes business will reach its break-even point faster therefore generating more profit. However, in order to crowd fund you may have to give away shares, this decrease Emilie\u2019s ownership of the business which could lead to her losing control of her business. which could lead to her losing control of her business.

This is because they can obtain the finance needed to expand such as opening their shop to sell high quality tea. Therefore they can attract more consumers interested in buying tea sourced from countries such as Kenya. This is because the citizens based in Shoreditch, London is limited in its ability to stock and sell a wide range of tea. As a result sales of Japanese and other teas will increase with finance from crowdfunding. Therefore the revenue brought in from selling high quality tea will increase.\n\nHowever, crowdfunding can be unreliable as it relies on the continued interest and support of investors. As a result good and proper tea will have a increased risk attached to ventures such as opening a second shop outside of London to sell its high quality international tea. Therefore Good nad Proper tea may not always be able to expand its tea sales as it may wish to due to a short fall in investments. In conclusion, it depends whether Googd and Proper tea has enough support for its individual and innovatibe methods such as selling tea out of a van or investments from crowdfunding websites to continue, and that investors are satisfied with the success of the business. Only then can they continue to use crowdfunding as a long tem source of finance.", "Response": "6 marks.\nThe candidate structures their response using three paragraphs. In the first paragraph, they\nconsider the benefits of crowdfunding, but in only a limited way. Much of this first paragraph\ndoes not deal with the effectiveness of crowdfunding itself, but instead with the benefits of\nGood and Proper Tea growing. There is some Application (AO2) in this paragraph, with\nreference to \u2018consumers interested in buying teas sourced from (different countries)\u2019. The\nsecond paragraph offers some balance, but in a simple way, by considering the possible\ndrawbacks of crowdfunding. This Evaluation (AO3b) is then developed by a final conclusion.\nHowever, this conclusion offers only simple insights and is based on a rather limited evaluation\nof the information.\nOverall, the response was found to be placed in Level 2."}]
