        "Context": "Good and Proper Tea was founded in 2012 by Emilie Holmes. The business website states:\n\u2018We source our teas from around the world, from Kenya to India, Japan to China and many more places in between. It is important to us that we know exactly where each tea comes from and who is responsible for harvesting the leaves we buy. We will always share this information with our customers\u2019.\nThe business started when Emilie converted an old Citro\u00ebn van (pictured right) into a mobile brew bar. Emilie wanted to expand the business. To achieve this she needed finance. She decided to raise finance using crowdfunding through the Kickstarter website. 372 individual backers each provided between \u00a31 and \u00a31000. Good and Proper Tea was launched. The first cup of tea was brewed and sold in Shoreditch, London, in 2012. The success of the mobile business led Emilie to plan to open a shop selling the same high-quality teas. Once again she decided to use crowdfunding as her source of finance. This time, using the Crowdcube website, she successfully raised \u00a3140,000. The shop was opened in 2016 and is very successful. As Good and Proper Tea imports its most important ingredient, it is affected by changes in the exchange rate. Recent changes in the value of the pound mean that its costs have increased.",
        "Answer": "Crowdfunding is when business to a source of finance in which business\u2019 ask for money online to launch a new idea in return for a reward eg. shares in the company. Crowdfunding is effective for Good and Proper Tea because it allows them to raise a lot of interest free capital, this allows them to expand their hot beverage selling business without using retained profit, therefore it can use that to further expand its business, for example they could open more shops that sell their cups of tea. This would  have more sales, therefore more revenue would be generated, therefore Emilie Holmes business will reach its break-even point faster therefore generating more profit. However, in order to crowd fund you may have to give away shares, this decrease Emilie\u2019s ownership of the business which could lead to her losing control of her business. which could lead to her losing control of her business. In conclusion crowdfunding is good if the idea is innovative and the public are willing to fund it.",
        "Response": "The candidate starts off with a definition of crowdfunding which is accurate. In the second paragraph, the candidate starts to develop the rationale behind why crowdfunding is an effective way to raise capital through \u2018interest free\u2019 and \u2018expand their hot beverage selling business without using retained profit\u2019 and \u2018therefore it can further expand\u2019. At this point the candidate starts to drift off the question and starts to answer a question about the benefits of expansion. Nevertheless, sufficient linked strands have been generated to allow the response to reach Level 2 for Analysis or AO3a. The evaluation is contained in both paragraphs 3 and 4 and involves simple statements generating an overall score in Level 1. Application is primarily confined to the middle paragraph with the word \u2018Emilie\u2019 appearing in paragraph 3. This skill was awarded L1/2. Regarding understanding or AO1b, the candidate uses terminology well throughout the response and it is accurate, but because the candidate drifted off the question, Level 2 was awarded for this skill.\nOverall, the response was placed in Level 2 and 5 marks were awarded."

        "Answer": "Crowdfunding is where businesses use online crowdfunding websites to ask investors to invest in their business in exchange for shares, discounted products or access to event/exclusive offers. \nA benefit to Good and proper tea of using crowdfunding is that it allows their business to grow. This is because they can obtain the finance needed to expand such as opening their shop to sell high quality tea. Therefore they can attract more consumers interested in buying tea sourced from countries such as Kenya. This is because the citizens based in Shoreditch, London is limited in its ability to stock and sell a wide range of tea. As a result sales of Japanese and other teas will increase with finance from crowdfunding. Therefore the revenue brought in from selling high quality tea will increase.\nHowever, crowdfunding can be unreliable as it relies on the continued interest and support of investors. As a result good and proper tea will have a increased risk attached to ventures such as opening a second shop outside of London to sell its high quality international tea. Therefore Good nad Proper tea may not always be able to expand its tea sales as it may wish to due to a short fall in investments. In conclusion, it depends whether Googd and Proper tea has enough support for its individual and innovatibe methods such as selling tea out of a van or investments from crowdfunding websites to continue, and that investors are satisfied with the success of the business. Only then can they continue to use crowdfunding as a long tem source of finance.",
        "Response": "The candidate structures their response using three paragraphs. In the first paragraph, they consider the benefits of crowdfunding, but in only a limited way. Much of this first paragraph does not deal with the effectiveness of crowdfunding itself, but instead with the benefits of Good and Proper Tea growing. There is some Application (AO2) in this paragraph, with reference to \u2018consumers interested in buying teas sourced from (different countries)\u2019. The second paragraph offers some balance, but in a simple way, by considering the possible drawbacks of crowdfunding. This Evaluation (AO3b) is then developed by a final conclusion. However, this conclusion offers only simple insights and is based on a rather limited evaluation of the information.\nOverall, the response was placed in Level 2 and 6 marks were awarded."
