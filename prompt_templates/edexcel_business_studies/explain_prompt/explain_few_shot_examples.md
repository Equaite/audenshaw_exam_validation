This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one way'. Thus, it is subtly different to an 'Explain one benefit...' question. The candidate has suggested a way through 'instagram can be used to collect polls of people's opinions...' and this is developed through 'by the amount of support  the advert receives...' The candidate then does not further develop their answer.
