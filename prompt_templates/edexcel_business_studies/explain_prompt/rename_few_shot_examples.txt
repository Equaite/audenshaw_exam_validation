Social media e.g. instagram can be used to collect polls of people's opinions by the amount of support the advert receives or through comments left on the post.

Response:
This question requires the candidate to ‘Explain one way’. Thus, it is subtly different to
an ‘Explain one benefit…’ question. The candidate has suggested a way through
‘Instagram can be used to collect polls of people’s opinions…’ and this is developed
through ‘by the amount of support the advert receives…’ The candidate then does not
further develop their answer. Overall, this answer should be awarded 2 marks out of the total 3.
