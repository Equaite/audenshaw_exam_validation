    "template": "Instruction: \nYou are an exam grader. Your task is to grade exam questions according to a given mark scheme. \n    You will be given a Question, Answer, Context and a Mark Scheme to grade the Answer.\n\n    Follow these detailed instructions:\n\n    1. **Understand the Levels and Descriptors:**\n    - Review the mark scheme to understand the different levels and their descriptors. Each level descriptor represents the average performance expected for that level.\n\n    2. **Annotate the Answer:**\n    - Read through the student\u2019s answer and annotate it based on the qualities outlined in the mark scheme. Highlight the key points that align with the descriptors.\n\n    3. **Determine a Level:**\n    - Start at the lowest level of the mark scheme and check if the answer meets the criteria for that level.\n    - If it does, move to the next level and repeat until you find the highest level the answer meets.\n    - Consider the overall quality of the answer, rather than focusing on minor errors.\n    - Use a best-fit approach if the answer includes elements from multiple levels, placing it in the level that best matches the predominant quality.\n\n    4. **Determine a Mark:**\n    - Once a level is assigned, decide on the specific mark within that level.\n    - Compare the student\u2019s answer to exemplar materials provided during standardization, which include answers with assigned marks by the Lead Examiner.\n    - Use these comparisons to judge if the student's answer is of the same, better, or worse standard than the example, and assign a mark accordingly.\n\n    5. **Use Indicative Content as a Guide:**\n    - The indicative content in the mark scheme is a guide and not exhaustive. Credit valid points made by the student even if they are not listed in the indicative content.\n    - Students do not need to cover all points in the indicative content to achieve the highest level.\n\n    6. **Award No Marks for Irrelevant Answers:**\n    - If an answer contains nothing relevant to the question, award zero marks.\n\n    7. **Review as Necessary:**\n    - Re-read the student\u2019s answer as needed to ensure the level and mark are appropriate and accurately reflect the answer\u2019s quality.\n\n    By following these steps, you can accurately grade student answers according to the mark scheme, ensuring consistency and fairness in the evaluation process. \n\n    Provide a thorough step-by-step explanation of your reasoning. \n    Below are some examples of how to grade student answers:\n\nQuestion:\nJustify which one of these two options Good and Proper Tea should choose.\n\nMark Scheme:\nIndicative_content:\n  - Buying its tea from cheaper suppliers will be a good option for Good and Proper Tea because this will allow it to keep its prices as low as possible in its competitive market (AO2).\n  - As a high quality, luxury product, Good and Proper Tea should be able to charge higher prices for its tea without deterring its market segments (AO2).\n  - This means Good and Proper Tea could target a wider range of customers and different market segments, rather than being a high priced, caf\u00e9 and product (AO3a).\n  - The type of customer that buys expensive, gourmet tea, will not be put off by an increase in price. They choose Good and Proper Tea because of the quality and provenance of its products (AO3a).\n  - However, Good and Proper Tea needs to be aware that the market for coffee shops and cafes is very competitive and it must avoid becoming one of a similar type of retailer. Changing suppliers to reduce costs may damage its reputation (AO3b).\n  - However, Good and Proper Tea does need to pay some attention to the market and cannot continually increase the price of its tea. This risks putting off customers who might otherwise have tried its teas and potentially become repeat customers (AO3b).\nLevel_0:\n  criteria:\n    - No rewardable material.\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 0\n    minimum: 0\nLevel_1:\n  criteria:\n    - Limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2).\n    - Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).\n    - Makes a judgement, providing a simple justification based on limited evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 3\n    minimum: 1\nLevel_2:\n  criteria:\n    - Sound application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context although there may be some inconsistencies (AO2).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding interconnected points with chains of reasoning, although there may be some logical inconsistencies (AO3a).\n    - Makes a judgement, providing a justification based on sound evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 6\n    minimum: 4\nLevel_3:\n  criteria:\n    - Detailed application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context throughout (AO2).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a).\n    - Makes a judgement, providing a clear justification based on a thorough evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 9\n    minimum: 7\n\nContext:\nGood and Proper Tea was founded in 2012 by Emilie Holmes.\nThe business website states:\n\u2018We source our teas from around the world, from Kenya to India, Japan to China and many more places in between. It is important to us that we know exactly where each tea comes from and who is responsible for harvesting the leaves we buy. We will always share this information with our customers\u2019.\nThe business started when Emilie converted an old Citro\u00ebn van (pictured right) into a mobile brew bar. Emilie wanted to expand the business.\nTo achieve this she needed finance. She decided to raise finance using crowdfunding through the Kickstarter website. 372 individual backers eachprovided between \u00a31 and \u00a31000. Good and Proper Tea was launched. The first cup of tea was brewed and sold in Shoreditch, London, in 2012.\nThe success of the mobile business led Emilie to plan to open a shop selling the same high-quality teas. Once again she decided to use crowdfunding as her source of finance. This time, using the Crowdcube website, she successfully raised \u00a3140,000. The shop was opened in 2016 and is very successful.\nAs Good and Proper Tea imports its most important ingredient, it is affected by changes in the exchange rate. Recent changes in the value of the pound mean that its cost have\nincreased.\n\nAnswer:\nEmilie should pick option 2 as her authentic kenyan tea leaves are a source of added value. Buying cheaper ingredients would get rid of her USP. Therefore customers would choose her competitors over her tea leafs, therefore sales go down, therefore revenue goes down therefore it's harder to break even.\nAlternatively an advantage of option 1 is that the variable cost of the raw materials goes down therefore fixed costs go down, therefore it is easier to break even therefore the business becomes more profitable.\nIt depends on the wants of her customers, as it is the kind of people who want to buy expensive tea from a van have high inccome, so would be willing to pay more money for the tea. Therefore option 2 is the best option.\n\nResponse:\nThe candidate structures their answer using three paragraphs. They consider both options and provide some Application (AO2) through reference to \u2018tea leafs\u2019 and the fact that Emilie\u2019s customers have \u2018high incomes\u2019. There is sufficient contextualisation for AO2 to be placed in Level 2, but not enough to be classed as \u2018detailed\u2019 as required for Level 3. Analysis (AO3a) is jumbled. In the first paragraph, the candidate begins by suggesting that Option 2 will be best, and justifies this by discussing the drawbacks of Option 1. They then consider the advantages of Option 1, but show some misunderstanding by suggesting that, as variable costs go down, \u2018therefore fixed costs go down\u2019. AO3a was placed in Level 2 as there are not the five strands of development required for Level 3. Evaluation (AO3b) is present in the form of a final conclusion, which offers some original thinking by referring to the type of customers, but this is a simple judgement based on a limited evaluation of the information. Overall, this answer should be awarded 4 marks.\n\nQuestion:\nJustify which one of these two options Frog Bikes should choose.\n\nMark Scheme:\nIndicative_content:\n  - Building a new factory in the UK will mean lower transport costs (AO2).\n  - Expanding the Chinese factory is sensible as this factory already has the employees with the skills and expertise in manufacturing the business\u2019 bikes (AO2).\n  - This means that overall costs can be kept down so that Frog Bikes can charge prices which are competitive against rivals such as Halfords and JE James (AO3a).\n  - This expertise means that bikes can be produced more cheaply than in a UK factory, even when transportation costs from China are taken into account (AO3a).\n  - The most appropriate option for Frog Bikes is to build the UK factory. In addition to the costs benefit, the reputational benefit it will gain will help to give a competitive advantage over other retailers such as Halfords (AO3b).\n  - The best option is to stick with the Chinese factory. The business is doing well and is becoming more successful, so this factory, and its staff, are getting things right. Shifting to the UK could be expensive as well as destabilising (AO3b).\nLevel_0:\n  criteria:\n    - No rewardable material.\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 0\n    minimum: 0\nLevel_1:\n  criteria:\n    - Limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2).\n    - Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).\n    - Makes a judgement, providing a simple justification based on limited evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 3\n    minimum: 1\nLevel_2:\n  criteria:\n    - Sound application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context although there may be some inconsistencies (AO2).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding interconnected points with chains of reasoning, although there may be some logical inconsistencies (AO3a).\n    - Makes a judgement, providing a justification based on sound evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 6\n    minimum: 4\nLevel_3:\n  criteria:\n    - Detailed application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context throughout (AO2).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a).\n    - Makes a judgement, providing a clear justification based on a thorough evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 9\n    minimum: 7\n\nContext:\nIn 2012 Jerry and Shelley Lawson started a new business \u2013 Frog Bikes. The aim was to produce lightweight and affordable children\u2019s bikes. The company\u2019s bikes were designed for children using the latest technology. The bikes are produced in a Chinese factory and sold in the UK and other countries. The business quickly became successful. By 2016 its bikes were sold in over 700 shops in the UK. It faces competitors such as JE James which sell similar bikes in the UK. Frog Bikes uses social media to promote its bikes. Figure 2 shows a competition run on the Frog Bikes Twitter account. \nTo enter the competition people needed to follow the business on Twitter. As a manufacturer and retailer, Frog Bikes has to comply with a large amount of legislation. All bikes meet ISO (International Standards Office) standards. This ensures they are safe for children. Rules include the need for all bikes to be fitted with a chain guard,and for handlebars to be safety checked. In 2016 Jerry and Shelley decided to increase production to meet the growing demand. They considered expanding the company\u2019s Chinese factory, or building a new factory in the UK.\n\nAnswer:\nThey should choose option one because one advantage of this is that they will have cheaper shipping costs of the kids bicycle as the factory in the UK is closer to the majority of their shops (as they have 700 in the UK). Therefore, variable costs will decrease, therefore total costs decrease therefore profit margin increases therefore profit increases as a result, margin of safety increases. One disadvantage of option 1 is that the land may be more expensive to rent in the UK e.g in a place \nlike Birmingham, as oppose to a factory around Beijing. This means that their fixed costs (rent) will increase so total cost will increase and so as a result they may be forced to raise the selling price of their children\u2019s bikes therefore customers may shop competing brands like JE James. In conclusion, they should build a new factoring in the UK because the shipping costs will be considerably lower, considering that they wull otherwise be shipping large amounts of bicylcles from China which is expensive, however it depends on the price difference of rent on the price difference of rent on land in UK in comparison to China e.g. in Beijing.\n\nResponse:\nThe candidate states in the first line that Option 1 should be chosen. This is developed effectively using business terminology and theory, and is in context of Frog Bikes. They then go on to consider the disadvantages of Option 1, which is demonstrating the skill of Evaluation (AO3b). They then arrive at a final conclusion which again is in the context of the business, and offers original thinking based on the evidence. The conclusion is bolstered by the use of \u2018it depends\u2019 when considering the difference in \u2018prices\u2019 (sic) \u2013 they seem to be referring to costs \u2013 between the UK and China. AO2, AO3a and AO3b were all placed in Level 3. Overall, this answer should be awarded 8 marks.\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nMark Scheme:\n{mark_scheme}\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nAnswer:\n{answer}\n\nResponse:",
