## Question:
Analyse the impact on Frog Bikes of the legislation it has to comly with when producing and selling its bikes.

## Mark Scheme:
Indicative_content:
  - The owners of Frog Bikes operate in a competitive market, with rivals such as Halfords, and sticking to legislation will reassure potential customers who are looking to buying a child’s bike (AO2).
  - By having to meet all safety requirement due to government legislation, Frog Bikes’ costs will be higher than they would be without such rules (AO2).
  - This will mean that Frog Bikes will establish a strong reputation with its market segments that will choose its bikes knowing they have the latest safety features. This will potentially lead to higher sales, which may lead to higher profits if other costs do not increase due to implementing the requirements of the legislation (AO3).
  - As a result of these higher costs, prices of its bikes may have to rise. Prices for a small business like Frog Bikes are likely to be higher than some of the larger producers. The price of the bikes may be more important than the safety features for parents, and as a result sales revenue may fall (AO3).

## Context:
In 2012 Jerry and Shelley Lawson started a new business – Frog Bikes. The aim was to produce lightweight and affordable children’s bikes. The company’s bikes were designed for children using the latest technology. The bikes are produced in a Chinese factory and sold in the UK and other countries. The business quickly became successful. By 2016 its bikes were sold in over 700 shops in the UK. It faces competitors such as JE James which sell similar bikes in the UK. Frog Bikes uses social media to promote its bikes.
Figure 2 shows a competition run on the Frog Bikes Twitter account. To enter the competition people needed to follow the business on Twitter. As a manufacturer and retailer, Frog Bikes has to comply with a large amount of legislation. All bikes meet ISO (International Standards Office) standards. This ensures they are safe for children. Rules include the need for all bikes to be fitted with a chain guard, and for handlebars to be safety checked. In 2016 Jerry and Shelley decided to increase production to meet the growing demand. They considered expanding the company’s Chinese factory, or building a new factory in the UK.

## Answer:
Frog Bikes bicycles have to meet ISO safety guidelines e.g. a chain saftely guard on each bicycle. This rule means the variable costs increase to pay for the precautions. Therefore the contribution per product decreases and the profit decreases. Also, as a result of these safety precautions on the cicycles parents would be more willing to purchase them. Therefore they make more sales of bicycles and the profits increase. This means total revenue increases so Jerry and Shelly Hawson have money to reinvest to impraove their cycling products.

## Response:
The candidate has answered the question by stating 2 impacts in two separate paragraphs. In the first paragraph, the candidate has stated the impact with ‘have to meet ISO safety guidelines’. This is then developed through ‘variable costs increase to pay for the precautions’, which is developed through ‘contribution per product decreases’ which is further developed through ‘the profit decreases’. The second paragraph states a second impact ‘parents would be more willing to purchase them’ which is developed through ‘therefore they make more sales of bicycles’ with further development through ‘and the profits increase’. The answer then breaks down in terms of logic with ‘this means total revenue increases’ which does not make logical sense following ‘profits increase’. Therefore, the response has the five logical, linked strands of analysis required to reach Level 3 on the mark scheme. In terms of ‘Application’ or AO2 the response is heavily laden with contextualisation throughout the answer with  terms such as ‘ISO safety guidelines’, ‘chain safety guards’, ‘bicycle’, ‘Jerry and Shelley’ and ‘parents’ being used throughout the answer. As a result, the response was also placed in Level 3 as for this assessment objective as well. Thus, the response generated a score of 6 marks in total.

They considered expanding the company’s Chinese factory, or building a new factory in the UK.

## Answer:
The legislation on bicycles means that Jerry and Shlley would have to invest more capitol into the production of their bikes to ensure they comply with the legal requirements of ISO e.g. regular handlebar safety checks. Tehrefore the variable costs of the cycling business increases. An impact of this would be that Jerry would have to increase the prices of each bicycle in order to generate enough contribution to pay off the total costs of production. However frog bikes competitiveness of being affordable would be lost, and so consumers would choose to shop at other brands such as JE James therefore the revenue of the business decreases, meaning that profit and retained profit decreases. Without retained profit Jerry and Shelley will be unable to expand their business e.g building a new production factory in England.

## Response:
The candidate identifies an impact ‘have to invest more capital into the production of their bikes’. This is then developed through ‘variable costs of the cycling business increases’ which is further developed through ‘Jerry would have to increase the price of each bicycle’. The candidate then makes a small error in that contribution is generated to pay off fixed costs not ‘total costs’. The candidate then continues to develop the answer with ‘of being affordable would be lost’ and then ‘consumers would choose to shop at JE James’ and ‘therefore the revenue of the business decreases’. Thus, the candidate has provided 5 linked strands of development allowing Level 3 to be awarded for AO3a or ‘Analysis’. The answer is heavily contextualised throughout from ‘Jerry and Shelley’ in the first sentence all the way down to ‘building a new production factory in England’. Therefore, the response is also placed in Level 3 for this skill also. Therefore, the response is awarded 6 marks, but this time from logical development of one impact.
