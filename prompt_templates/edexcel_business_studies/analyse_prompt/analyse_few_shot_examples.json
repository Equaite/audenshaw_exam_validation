This rule means the variable costs increase to pay for the precautions. Therefore the contribution per product decreases and the profit decreases. \n\nAlso, as a result of these safety precautions on the cicycles parents would be more willing to purchase them. Therefore they make more sales of bicycles and the profits increase. This means total revenue increases so Jerry and Shelly Hawson have money to reinvest to impraove their cycling products.", "Response": "6 marks.\nThe candidate has answered the question by stating 2 impacts in two separate\nparagraphs. In the first paragraph, the candidate has stated the impact with \u2018have to\nmeet ISO safety guidelines\u2019. This is then developed through \u2018variable costs increase to\npay for the precautions\u2019, which is developed through \u2018contribution per product\ndecreases\u2019 which is further developed through \u2018the profit decreases\u2019. The second\nparagraph states a second impact \u2018parents would be more willing to purchase them\u2019\nwhich is developed through \u2018therefore they make more sales of bicycles\u2019 with further\ndevelopment through \u2018and the profits increase\u2019. The answer then breaks down in terms\nof logic with \u2018this means total revenue increases\u2019 which does not make logical sense\nfollowing \u2018profits increase\u2019. Therefore, the response has the five logical, linked strands\nof analysis required to reach Level 3 on the mark scheme. In terms of \u2018Application\u2019 or\nAO2 the response is heavily laden with contextualisation throughout the answer with \n11\nterms such as \u2018ISO safety guidelines\u2019, \u2018chain safety guards\u2019, \u2018bicycle\u2019, \u2018Jerry and Shelley\u2019\nand \u2018parents\u2019 being used throughout the answer. As a result, the response was also\nplaced in Level 3 as for this assessment objective as well. Thus, the response generated\na score of 6 marks in total."}, {"Question": "Analyse the impact on Frog Bikes of the legislation it has to comly with when producing and selling its bikes.", "Mark Scheme": "Indicative_content:\n  - The owners of Frog Bikes operate in a competitive market, with rivals such as Halfords, and sticking to legislation will reassure potential customers who are looking to buying a child\u2019s bike (AO2).\n  - By having to meet all safety requirement due to government legislation, Frog Bikes\u2019 costs will be higher than they would be without such rules (AO2).\n  - This will mean that Frog Bikes will establish a strong reputation with its market segments that will choose its bikes knowing they have the latest safety features.

Tehrefore the variable costs of the cycling business increases. An impact of this would be that Jerry would have to increase the prices of each bicycle in order to generate enough contribution to pay off the total costs of production. However frog bikes competitiveness of being affordable would be lost, and so consumers would choose to shop at other brands such as JE James therefore the revenue of the business decreases, meaning that profit and retained profit decreases. Without retained profit Jerry and Shelley will be unable to expand their business e.g building a new production factory in England.", "Response": "6 marks.\nThe candidate identifies an impact \u2018have to invest more capital into the production of\ntheir bikes\u2019. This is then developed through \u2018variable costs of the cycling business\nincreases\u2019 which is further developed through \u2018Jerry would have to increase the price of\neach bicycle\u2019. The candidate then makes a small error in that contribution is generated\nto pay off fixed costs not \u2018total costs\u2019. The candidate then continues to develop the\nanswer with \u2018of being affordable would be lost\u2019 and then \u2018consumers would choose to\nshop at JE James\u2019 and \u2018therefore the revenue of the business decreases\u2019. Thus, the\ncandidate has provided 5 linked strands of development allowing Level 3 to be awarded\nfor AO3a or \u2018Analysis\u2019. The answer is heavily contextualised throughout from \u2018Jerry and\nShelley\u2019 in the first sentence all the way down to \u2018building a new production factory in\nEngland\u2019. Therefore, the response is also placed in Level 3 for this skill also. Therefore,\nthe response also scored 6 marks, but this time from logical development of one\nimpact."}]
