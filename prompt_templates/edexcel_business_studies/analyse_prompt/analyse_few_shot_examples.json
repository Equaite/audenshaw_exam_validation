        "Mark Scheme": "Indicative_content:\n  - The owners of Frog Bikes operate in a competitive market, with rivals such as Halfords, and sticking to legislation will reassure potential customers who are looking to buying a child\u2019s bike (AO2).\n  - By having to meet all safety requirement due to government legislation, Frog Bikes\u2019 costs will be higher than they would be without such rules (AO2).\n  - This will mean that Frog Bikes will establish a strong reputation with its market segments that will choose its bikes knowing they have the latest safety features. This will potentially lead to higher sales, which may lead to higher profits if other costs do not increase due to implementing the requirements of the legislation (AO3).\n  - As a result of these higher costs, prices of its bikes may have to rise. Prices for a small business like Frog Bikes are likely to be higher than some of the larger producers. The price of the bikes may be more important than the safety features for parents, and as a result sales revenue may fall (AO3).\nLevel_0:\n  criteria:\n    - No rewardable material.\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 0\n    minimum: 0\nLevel_1:\n  criteria:\n    - Limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2).\n    - Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 2\n    minimum: 1\nLevel_2:\n  criteria:\n    - Sound application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context although there may be some inconsistencies (AO2).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding interconnected points with chains of reasoning, although there may be some logical inconsistencies (AO3a).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 4\n    minimum: 3\nLevel_3:\n  criteria:\n    - Detailed application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context throughout (AO2).\n    - Deconstructs business information and/or issues, finding detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a).\n  marks_awarded:\n    maximum: 6\n    minimum: 5",
        "Context": "In 2012 Jerry and Shelley Lawson started a new business \u2013 Frog Bikes. The aim was to produce lightweight and affordable children\u2019s bikes. The company\u2019s bikes were designed for children using the latest technology. The bikes are produced in a Chinese factory and sold in the UK and other countries. The business quickly became successful. By 2016 its bikes were sold in over 700 shops in the UK. It faces competitors such as JE James which sell similar bikes in the UK. Frog Bikes uses social media to promote its bikes.\nFigure 2 shows a competition run on the Frog Bikes Twitter account. To enter the competition people needed to follow the business on Twitter. As a manufacturer and retailer, Frog Bikes has to comply with a large amount of legislation. All bikes meet ISO (International Standards Office) standards. This ensures they are safe for children. Rules include the need for all bikes to be fitted with a chain guard, and for handlebars to be safety checked. In 2016 Jerry and Shelley decided to increase production to meet the growing demand. They considered expanding the company\u2019s Chinese factory, or building a new factory in the UK.",
        "Answer": "Frog Bikes bicycles have to meet ISO safety guidelines e.g. a chain saftely guard on each bicycle. This rule means the variable costs increase to pay for the precautions. Therefore the contribution per product decreases and the profit decreases. Also, as a result of these safety precautions on the cicycles parents would be more willing to purchase them. Therefore they make more sales of bicycles and the profits increase. This means total revenue increases so Jerry and Shelly Hawson have money to reinvest to impraove their cycling products.",
        "Response": "The candidate has answered the question by stating 2 impacts in two separate paragraphs. In the first paragraph, the candidate has stated the impact with \u2018have to meet ISO safety guidelines\u2019. This is then developed through \u2018variable costs increase to pay for the precautions\u2019, which is developed through \u2018contribution per product decreases\u2019 which is further developed through \u2018the profit decreases\u2019. The second paragraph states a second impact \u2018parents would be more willing to purchase them\u2019 which is developed through \u2018therefore they make more sales of bicycles\u2019 with further development through \u2018and the profits increase\u2019. The answer then breaks down in terms of logic with \u2018this means total revenue increases\u2019 which does not make logical sense following \u2018profits increase\u2019. Therefore, the response has the five logical, linked strands of analysis required to reach Level 3 on the mark scheme. In terms of \u2018Application\u2019 or AO2 the response is heavily laden with contextualisation throughout the answer with  terms such as \u2018ISO safety guidelines\u2019, \u2018chain safety guards\u2019, \u2018bicycle\u2019, \u2018Jerry and Shelley\u2019 and \u2018parents\u2019 being used throughout the answer. As a result, the response was also placed in Level 3 as for this assessment objective as well. Thus, the response generated a score of 6 marks in total."

        "Answer": "The legislation on bicycles means that Jerry and Shlley would have to invest more capitol into the production of their bikes to ensure they comply with the legal requirements of ISO e.g. regular handlebar safety checks. Tehrefore the variable costs of the cycling business increases. An impact of this would be that Jerry would have to increase the prices of each bicycle in order to generate enough contribution to pay off the total costs of production. However frog bikes competitiveness of being affordable would be lost, and so consumers would choose to shop at other brands such as JE James therefore the revenue of the business decreases, meaning that profit and retained profit decreases. Without retained profit Jerry and Shelley will be unable to expand their business e.g building a new production factory in England.",
        "Response": "The candidate identifies an impact \u2018have to invest more capital into the production of their bikes\u2019. This is then developed through \u2018variable costs of the cycling business increases\u2019 which is further developed through \u2018Jerry would have to increase the price of each bicycle\u2019. The candidate then makes a small error in that contribution is generated to pay off fixed costs not \u2018total costs\u2019. The candidate then continues to develop the answer with \u2018of being affordable would be lost\u2019 and then \u2018consumers would choose to shop at JE James\u2019 and \u2018therefore the revenue of the business decreases\u2019. Thus, the candidate has provided 5 linked strands of development allowing Level 3 to be awarded for AO3a or \u2018Analysis\u2019. The answer is heavily contextualised throughout from \u2018Jerry and Shelley\u2019 in the first sentence all the way down to \u2018building a new production factory in England\u2019. Therefore, the response is also placed in Level 3 for this skill also. Therefore, the response is awarded 6 marks, but this time from logical development of one impact."
