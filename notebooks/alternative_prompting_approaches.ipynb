    "        \"Answer\": \"I think the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty of Versailles was their loss of land.\\nI agree that the Germans hated the treaty of Versailles due to the loss of territory as the\\nGermans lost 10% of their land. They lost the Saar for 15 years as it was given control to\\nFrance and the League of Nations. The Saar was a large industrial part of Germany that would\\nof helped them pay their \\u00a36,600 million reparations. They only got it back 15 years later when\\nthe plebiscite voted 90% for Germany. They also lost their colonies in Africa which were given\\nto Britain and provided them with lots of money and resources.\\nHowever their loss of military cover be the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty of\\nVersailles. Their army was reduced to 100,000 men and their navy reduced to 15,000. They\\nwere not allowed an air force or submarines. The Rhineland was a strip of land on the border\\nof France and Germany and the treaty of Versailles made them demilitarise the Rhineland.\\nThis left Germany feeling vulnerable to attack as it was well known that Georges Clemenceau\\nwanted revenge on Germany. This also led to Germans turning to Hitler as he promised a\\nstrong army and rearmaments. He increased army to 1,000,000 and built his Luftwaffe This\\naggression comes from their previous loss of their military.\\nOverall I believe that the loss of territory was the main reason for the Germans hatred of the\\ntreaty of Versailles as they lost the large industrial Saar as well as their colonies and they lost\\n6,000,000 German speaking people due to the 10% of their land lost.\",\n",

    "        \"Answer\": \"On one hand, I can agree with this statement because in total 13% of Germany\\u2019s land was\\ngiven away and was taken. This meant that many German people and German speaking\\npeople found themselves out of Germany. All of Germany\\u2019s colonies in Africa were taken away\\nas mandates but in reality, they were given to Britain and France. Additionally Alsace Lorraine\\nwas returned to France and the Rhineland was demilitarised meaning even parts of Germany\\nitself wasn\\u2019t properly controlled by Germany. The Saar was also taken which contained lost of\\nindustrial business. This meant that the once great power of Germany felt stripped of its\\npower and many German people were forced to be a part of another new country.\\nHowever, War guilt could be seen as the main reason why the Germans hated the treaty so\\nmuch because firstly, article 231, the war guilt clause pointed all the blame on Germany and\\nthe German people. This made the German population feel humiliated and they thought it\\nwas unfair because the Kaiser and the German government started the war, not the German\\npeople and how that the Kaiser had been humiliated and fled to Holland and they had a new\\nWeimar republic, they believed that the blame shouldn\\u2019t solely be on Germany. The people of\\nGermany believe that the \\u2018November criminals\\u2019 signed the \\u2018diktat\\u2019 and it was their fault\\nhowever, they did not understand that the government did not have a choice and have to sign\\nthe armistice or war would have continued.\\nThe Germans also hated the reparations and restrictions from the military. Firstly the\\nGermans were made to pay \\u00a36.6 billion in reparations to pay for the damage of the war.\\nGermany was already struggling at the time (and people were homeless and dying of\\nstarvation of starvation. These reparations mostly effected the people who were not to blame\\nfor the war. Also the military, which used to be a proud part of Germany was restricted to\\n100,000 men, 6 battleships, 15,000 sailors in the navy, no airforce and no submarines. This\\ngave Britain naval supremacy which was humiliating for the Germans and only gave them\\nenough army to defend themselves.\\nWhat the Germans did not understand is that the treaty could have been much harsher, but\\nthe humiliation of the war guilt was probably the main factor because it hit the German\\npeople hard and made them outcasts to the rest of Europe and the fact that they were not\\nallowed to join the League of Nations probably made it worse for them.

The U2 spy plane made USSR think that the USA was spying on them, which they were, and cause a major increase in the lack of trust between USA and USSR.\\nAt the time of the U2 spy plane the space race was also going on at the same time. The space race took up major amounts of money for USA and USSR. The risk of USA finding out USSR secrets with the spy plane would mean major loss for the USSR.\\nKhrushchev was very worried about the plane so he shot it down. The pilot refused to say anything so he was killed.\\nThe Space race was a major source of tension as it was a way to prove which leadership is strongest USA or USSR.\\nDuring the 1960s the Cuban Missile Crisis was also happening which was major tension as Cuba is just 90 miles off the coast of Florida and USSR control so close was very dangerous for the USA. During the CMC the world was at the closest point it has ever been to nuclear war.\\nI agree with this statement because the spy plane was a direct threat to the USSR and it caused huge tension between USA and USSR as it was clear evidence that USA had been spying on them and that the USA could have information about the amount of weapons they have and also the development of the space race in the USSR.\",\n",

    "        \"Answer\": \"During the 1960\\u2019s although the U2 Crisis did cause tension to develop between the East and the West. I think other factors like the Cuban Missile Crisis may have been the main reason for the development of tension between the two superpowers.\\nIn 1960, an American pilot, Gary Powers \\u2013 was flying the U2 spy plane over the USSR. This plane was shot down by the Soviets when it was flying closer to the ground and both Powers\\u2019 and the plan was captured. This all took place while the Paris peace summit was also ongoing. When America was questioned by the Soviet\\u2019s \\u2013 for multiple days. Eisenhower lied and used the excuse that it was a weather plane and denied any wrongdoing or espionage. After a few days the Soviets assessed the wreckage of the U2 plane and discovered technology like cameras that could read a newspaper from 20,000 feet in the air \\u2013 monitoring equipment and even a cyanide pill. All of this equipment indicated that it was in fact a spy plane and Eisenhower had lied to Khrushchev\\u2019s face. At the Paris peace summit talks Eisenhower then refused to apologise for the U2 spy plane which caused Khrushchev to walk out of the talks and ended the peace talks and ended any chance of the \\u2018thaw\\u2019. This increased tension as it was clear that espionage and spying had been taking place in the Soviet skies with all of the improved technology and Eisenhower had lied to Khrushchev and refused to show any remorse for their decisions showing that America did not feel in the wrong about the spying. This then infuriated the Soviet\\u2019s and increased the distrust between the two superpowers and led to a spike in tension.\\nOn the other hand, events in 1962 led to a massive increase in tension during the event. In the early 1960\\u2019s Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba as a big communist believer. Geographically Cuba is quite near to the USA and was a big difference to the spread of communism in the East. Once the Soviet\\u2019s started to get involved with Castro and the leading of Cuba, America were seeing this as a failure of the Truman Doctrine and containment of Communism. During the Bay of Pigs \\u2013 John. F. Kennedy decided that they were going to threaten to stop exporting their sugar supply that was mainly from Cuba and also started putting blockades up against any Soviet ships trying to enter. This event between John. F. Kennedy and Khrushchev was the closest the world had ever come to Nuclear war which would not just affect the two superpowers of USA and USSR but in fact the whole of the East and West. Although it never reached the extremity of Nuclear war because of the reminder and realisation of Mutually Assured Destruction, it was the highest that tension and the threat between the East and the West.\\nIn conclusion, I believe that the U2 crisis was not the main reason for tension but actually the Cuban Missile Crisis as although there was a Test Ban treaty in 1963 during the Cuban Missile Crisis tension was at its highest than ever before and was not just affecting the two superpowers mainly like the U2 crisis but the whole of the East and West with threats of complete Nuclear War.\",\n",

    "        \"Answer\": \"One of the reasons for tensions developing between East and West during the 1960s was the U2 Crisis. This was because the U2 Crisis had the potential to damage relations irreparably. The U2 Crisis was where a US spy plane was spotted and shot down in Soviet territory. Eisenhower at first claimed that the plane was a weather plane, this was proven to be false, however, as there were cameras on the plane and the pilot, Gary Powers, was carrying a cynide pill. When America admitted to it being a spy plane no apology was given, nor was it promised to not happen again. This increased tensions as it led to Krushchev walking out of the Paris Peace Summit shortly after. While this crisis did develop tensions it did not increase them to the point of potential war and therefore it was not the main reason for tensions developing between East and West during the 1960s.\\nA final reason for tensions developing between East and West during the 1960\\u2019s was the Cuban Missile Crisis. This was because the Cuban Missile Crisis has the potential to cause a nuclear war. The Cuban Missile Crisis was where the USSR was found to be keeping weapons, like ICBMs in Cubs. This worried the USA as Cuba was extremely close to it compared to where the Soviet Union was to the USA. This meant that the Soviet Union could easily and quickly destroy USA cities due to the close range. The USA responded to this by causing what was essentially a naval quarantine on ships heading to Cuba where they would check the ships for military weapons before letting them through. At this point the USA had reached DEFCON 2, the highest risk of nuclear war it has ever seen. Thankfully, both sides decided to back down with the USSR removing its weapons from Cuba and the USA removing its weapons from Turkey. This was the main reason for tensions as it risked nuclear war.\\nOverall, the Cuban Missile Crisis was the main reason for tensions developing between East and West during the 1960s. While both the Berlin Wall and the O2 crisis did increase tensions, they did not raise them to the point that the Cuban Missile Crisis did, nor did they risk the total destruction that it did either therefore it was Cuba that was the main reason for tensions developing in the 1960\\u2019s. The Cuban Missile Crisis highlighted to potential that the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D) could become a reality.\",\n",

This paragraph then starts to develop a judgement by evaluating the severity of the risk and the tensions at this point. \\u2018it did not increase them to the point of potential war and therefore it was not the main reason\\u2026.\\u2019. This sentence is a good indicator of a potential level 4 answer as the student is starting to build a sustained judgement and setting out criteria for a complex, sustained line of reasoning.\\nIn paragraph 2 (it seems like a middle paragraph about the Berlin Wall may have been removed here to keep the answer to a reasonable length for the exercise), the student explains an alternative factor \\u2013 the Cuban Missile Crisis. Again, there is factual knowledge demonstrated at a good level of detail.

This is a second level 3 paragraph.\\nThe conclusion secures level 4 by comparing the relative severity of the different events \\u2018while both the Berlin Wall and the O2 crisis did raise tensions, they did not\\u2026 risk the total destruction\\u2019 of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This line of reasoning has been sustained throughout the answer, and is then brought together in the conclusion.\\nOverall, this answer falls into level 4 and should be awarded 15 marks.\"\n",

Therefore the next day in 1964, or 1965, everything had corrupted, this led to the declaration of war which was why the conflict in Vietnam had escalated in the 1960\\u2019s.\\nI do not agree that the Gulf of Tonkin was the main reason why the conflict escalated in Vietnam because another event had taken place called Dien Bien Phu. Dien Bien Phu was when the French army had got destroyed so it had meant that in result to this, led to the conflict in Vietnam to escalate in the 1960\\u2019s\\nI do agree with the statement because the Gulf of Tonkin had led to a Gulf of Tonkin resolution which was in 1964, when after the right of being able to attack, It led to the declaration of war, which was the main reason why the conflict in Vietnam had escalated very quickly.\\nI do not agree with this statement because another reason why the conflict in Vietnam escalated in the 1960\\u2019s was the Domino theory. This theory was about when if one country had fallen with communism others would go down as well with communism. This had led to a major escalation in Vietnam because the other countries didn\\u2019t want to be communist. To conclude this, I agree that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was the main reason as to why the conflict had escalated in Vietnam because it led to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution which was when they had declared war in the 1964 and was the main reason why the Vietnam War had escalated.\",\n",

    "        \"Answer\": \"I agree with this statement that one of the main reasons that conflict escalated in Vietnam was because of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. The Gulf of Tonkin incident is where one of the USA ships, the Maddox, was attacked with missiles. American officials were told that this was an attack from North Vietnam which led to the US getting more involved in the war, from this point LBJ set up operation Rolling Thunder, a bombing campaign against North Vietnam. The use of chemical weapons and bombing lead to many North Vietnamese people livelihoods had been destroyed encouraging them to fight back.\\nHowever, I do think that there are other incidents that led to the increase in conflict such as Americas search and destroy tactics. This tactic was where Americans troops would search, raid, destroy and burn villages looking for Viet Cong members, this was difficult however because the Viet Cong didn\\u2019t were uniforms, so the US troops were killing innocent people. This led to many more Vietnamese people going into the jungle and joining the Viet Cong to fight against the Americans.\\nFurthermore, I think another incident that increase the conflict was the Tet Offensive and the My Lai Massacre in 1968. The My Lai Massacre was where some soldiers from US troops went to My Lai and slaughtered 400 innocent Vietnamese civilians however American officials tried to keep this secret until 1969. The unfair killings and treatment led to a lot of a ger and further tension in Vietnam, making them more determined to resist and win the war.\\nLastly, another reason conflict started to escalate in the 1960\\u2019s was when Diem was in charge of South Vietnam. The USA chose Diem to be in charge because they felt like he could easily be manipulated and controlled, however he wasn\\u2019t, he ignored the Geneva agreement and rigged votes this meant that the south Vietnamese started to resist him. The Ho-Chi-Minh trail was erected to help supply them with supplies and resistant groups were set up such as the NLF who would fight and kill government officials involved with him. Eventually the US agreed to a coup being organised against him and he was assassinated in 1963.\",\n",

    "        \"Answer\": \"The Gulf of Tonkin incident was a significant reason for the rising conflict in Vietnam in the 1960s. This was an incident where, on the 4 August 1964, as US destroyer ship, \\u2018Maddox\\u2019, detected a North Vietnamese attack. However the captain who raised the alarm had doubts and saw his men may have read the sonar wrong, Nevertheless, on 7th August 1964, due to these reports, the government passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution giving US President Johnson the power to take any military action necessary to stop the spread of communism and the power of the North Vietnamese in Vietnam. This incident officially started the war allowing combat troops to be sent. Without this incident, combat troops may never have been sent to Vietnam and so it is extremely significant in it\\u2019s role as amplifying conflict.\\nAnother reason why conflict escalated was due to international American politics in 1960\\u2019s. The president from 1963-68, Johnson, maintained an ant-communist stance and supported president Eisenhower, a previous president, in his idea of the domino theory. This was the idea that of one country fell to communism, every country around it would be affecting US trade. Because US hatred for communism was high, Johnson had to appear tough on communism to maintain public support. Additionally, to become president, weapons companies funded presidential campaigns in hope they will primary weapons providers in war. Thus, this theory of the Military Industrial Complex stakes that Johnson may have felt pressured to be involved in the war to make profit for these companies, appeasing big businesses. This internal American politics was an important driving force behind many of the American\\u2019s actions in Vietnam.\\nConflict was also escalated due to the Viet Cong\\u2019s tactics, The Viet Cong were a guerilla force, fighting against the UIS and South Vietnamese army in the south. Their tactics were effective in disorientating the US as they had no uniform, no known headquarters, hid in jungles and tunnels they constructed. They also ambushed Americans accounting for 51% of US deaths and used booby traps like punji traps (sharpened bamboo in the ground covered with leaves). Booby traps accounted for 11% of US casualties and instilled widespread paranoia in the US soldiers leading to low morale. As a result, the American army found it difficult to progress against the Viet Cong and soldiers grew angry, in part leading to events like the My Lai Massacre on 16th March 1968 where US soldiers killed 500 people, mostly innocent women, children and elderly. The US also employed the use of agent orange, a chemical weapon, to attempt to burn the jungle so the Viet Cong would find it harder to hide, which destroyed acres of jungle. And they used operation Rolling Thunder to drop over a million tonnes of bombs on Vietnam. Thus, the Viet Cong\\u2019s tactics caused the Americans to act in desperation, killing civilians and destroying the county\\u2019s environment, in turn, leading to conflict developing as more Vietnamese civilians turned to the Viet Cong for support, and they were more resilient than ever in their drive for liberation due to the oppressive, violent nature of the Americans and their attempts to outsmart Viet Cong tactics.\\nTo conclude, the Gulf of Tonkin incident was an important reason for conflict amplification. However, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which allowed for original conflict to begin, may not have been passed if it was not for internal American politics and US policy of containment which caused them to have destroyer ships in the Gulf in the first place as a threat to the communist north. Accordingly, the Viet Cong\\u2019s tactics lead to increased conflict in Vietnam, as the US restored to harsh tactics to devastate the country and lower support for the Viet Cong. This lengthened the period of the war as the Viet Cong did not give up as easily as the US had hoped. However, America would not be using such harsh tactics or be in Vietnam to begin with, again, if it was not for the US negative attitudes to communism, and for politicians\\u2019 need to show that they will be harsh against communism leading to their use of chemical warfare in retaliation and mass bombing campaigns.\",\n",

    "        \"Answer\": \"The Iran Iraq War began in 1980 with an Iraq offensive on Iranian forces, this was because of trade, land and religious sectarian disputes between the two nations. However also because of the Iranian revolution in 1998 which was supported by Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini. He wanted the Shia belief to spread across the Arab world so he could have a larger theocracy. This revolution led to a threat of uprising for Saddam Hussein who was the Iraqi leader and a Sunni Muslim. Iraq was a largely Shia population as well. So, to prevent an attack on Iraq, Saddam decided to strike first on Iranian forces to show strength and unite his nation against a common cause.\\nThe war lasted 8 years (1980-88) and many conflicts and disputes were inconclusive on resolving dilemmas over trade, oil and land control. Iraq suffered 5 hundred thousand casualties as a result of the war, and also was left in a debt of $8 billion to several counties across the world. Iraq also had trade and military sanctions placed on them by the UN, meaning other countries were reluctant to trade and import goods to Iraq. This left Iraq in a state of bankruptcy an extreme poverty. Because not only was Iraq deprived of goods, but also not allowed to extract large amounts of oil had. This resulted losing more than 50% of it\\u2019s income. Therefore this created tension in the gulf because Iraq were in turmoil and needed a way out which posed a threat to neighboring countries such as Kuwait who could not defend and Iraq invasion to steal resources like oil.\\nIran suffered 1 million casualties and were on the verge of bankruptcy after 8 years of fighting, this meant that their country was now in deep poverty and dismay. Furthermore, there was unrest in the country because of the difficulty period and lack of progress from the war, meaning there could have been an uprising at any moment. Many Iranian and Iraqi lives were lost over the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway (a thin strip of trade route bordering Iran and Iraq) yet the control over the area was still disputed by the two countries creating tension in the gulf even after 8 years of fighting.\",\n",

His economy was ruined by the war so he tried to get Kuwait to increase their oil prices so that he could then do the same, allowing for Iraq\\u2019s economy to rebuild. Their refusal was what caused Saddam to annex them, causing the 1990 Gulf War. This war then caused religious massacres which caused a huge amount of tension among religious groups, many of whom were also angry at the West after their failure to kill or capture Saddam.\\nFurthermore, many nations were worried that Saddam would target them, particularly Saudi Arabia as they were world leaders in the Oil market. All neighboring countries were scared and with Iraq being landlocked, surrounded by nations whose economics were comprised of Oil trading, it led to unprecedented tension, Things only worsened after the 9/11 attacks, orchestrated by Osama Bin laden who had previously supported America. His change in attitude towards west was likely due to Saddam not being punished over the war and genocides.\\nOsama then evaded US troops for a decade, causing America to ignite a second Gulf War which used a forged piece of evidence on Saddam breaking the peace treaty as a basis for the invasion. This angered Gulf citizens as the invasion was without justification. Even after Saddam was killed, America and other allied nations continued to occupy middle eastern nations, leading to constant battle and many defeats. Gulf citizens blamed the wets due to the usage of fake evidence for the occupation.\\nIn conclusion, the Iran-Iraq war led to a two-decade war, the largest terrorist attacks ever seen, multiple genocides, invasions and occupations and the biggest political scandal of the 21st century. The fact that all these atrocities stemmed from the embers of the Iran-Iraq war leads me to conclude that it was responsible for an overwhelming amount of tension in the Gulf.\",\n",

This is a brief explanation of another factor and so places the answer into level 3.\\nThe discussion of 9/11 and its consequences, although well explained, is not relevant to the question, which specifies 1990.

    "        \"Answer\": \"I agree to a certain extent that the Iran-Iraq War was the main reason for tension in the Gulf in 1990, although a very important reason, it is a combination of multiple factors such as the Israeli Palestine conflict, Saddam Hussein wanting to develop a larger international reputation and American troops being stationed in Saudi Arabia.\\nOne reason for the tension in the Gulf was the consequences of the Iran-Iraq War from 1980- 1988. The war ended in a stalemate which means that neither side gained anything. Both sides lost millions of dollars of money and casualties. The issue hadn\\u2019t been resolved which means the tension between the two was now at an all time high. The Iran-Iraq war also split the Arab countries public opinion with some countries supporting Iraq (US + western countries) and some supporting Iran (Pakistan). The US also played a big part is the Iran-Iraq War with supplying weapons to Iraq (publicly) and to Iran (privately) This means that both countries were weaker so America could maintain its global hold on the Middle East and its oil.\\nAlthough the Iran-Iraq War was a more important reason the continued Israeli-Palestine conflict was still dividing the Middle East\\u2019s public opinion. After being establish in the mid 1900\\u2019s its existence was born challenged territorially (by Palestine because some of Palestines land was taken away) and religiously because Israel is a Jewish country. There has been constant Israeli-Palestine conflict since its founding which means different countries in the Middle East have different opinions. Israel is supported by US + Western countries and Palestine being supported by Iraq + Pakistan. This tension was escalated by the continued unwanted influence of the US troops and government.\\nThe main reason for tension in the Gulf in 1990 was Saddam Hussein (leader of Iraq) wanted to extend his global territory and wanted a better international relationship because he was seen as weak internationally after the Iran-Iraq War. This means that Saddam aimed to invade Kuwait. This was the pinnacle of tension in the Gulf. There was a UN coalition formed and Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield commenced in 1991. Saddam aimed to get rid of his debt and claimed that Kuwait was historically part of Iraq. This meant that another war had been broken out in an already fractured and crumbled Middle East. This was where the most tension came from.\\nIn conclusion the main reason for tension and conflict in the Gulf in 1990 was Saddam\\u2019s global policy of wanting to extend his power and reach and boost his reputation after the bad outcome of the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988. The Israeli-Palestine conflict contributed to this and America\\u2019s constant influence on the region only heightened the already high tensions.\",\n",
    "        \"Response\": \"This is a well-structured answer with a sustained judgement, as the student sets out their argument in a brief introduction and evaluates each factor at the end of each paragraph. The first paragraph explains the stated factor. There is a good range of accurate knowledge and understanding shown and a clear explanation of how this increased tension in 1990.\\nThe second paragraph explains a second factor \\u2013 \\u2018the Israeli-Palestine conflict\\u2019 \\u2013 again showing a good range of factual knowledge and clearly explaining the ways that tension was increased. The knowledge could be developed further here with more specific detail. The third paragraph explains a third factor -  Saddam Hussein\\u2019s desire to extend his global territory \\u2013 and the invasion of Kuwait. The importance of this is clearly explained again, supported by factual knowledge. The judgement is sustained as the paragraph begins \\u2018the main reason for tension in the Gulf was..\\u2019, building the argument throughout the essay.\\nThe conclusion repeats earlier points and clarifies the judgement made, making links between the factors.
