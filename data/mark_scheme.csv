• As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with
the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy
sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to
develop new skills. (AO2).
• If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would
have more retained profit to invest into the business. This
could result in cheaper energy being provided to its
members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment
and could then expand into other green business ideas
(AO3a).
• Training courses can be expensive. Sending new
employees on these courses would increase the costs of
Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training
then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment
into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
• However, the business is owned by the customers and the
main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would
limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the
business (AO3b).

 knowledge and understanding that is relevant to the question
 -Students may progress from a basic narrative of causation/consequence by
 showing a simple understanding of sequencing, supporting it with factual
 knowledge and understanding.
 -example answer: ‘the German advance through Belgium was slowed down by
 fighting Belgian and British troops. The French were able to push back the
 German front line but both sides needed to build trenches to protect
 themselves.’

 -Answer is presented as general statements which demonstrates basic

 -Students identify cause(s)/consequence(s) about the events such as the
 Schlieffen Plan did not happen as quickly as planned and so the German army
 had to dig trenches.

    - Students may progress from a developed narrative of causation/consequence with complex sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate and detailed factual knowledge and understanding which might be related, for example, to an analysis of how/why tension increased at different stages and/or showing understanding about how much each part of the sequence increased tension and led to a crisis.
  example_answer: 
    - 'the success of the Schlieffen Plan depended on the speed of its execution but the Germans failed to defeat France within the planned timescale of 6 weeks. The Germans underestimated the resolve and reaction times of its enemies. However, whilst the Germans were not successful in their primary objective, neither were they entirely defeated. When both sides sought to protect the territory gained by digging trenches, stalemate resulted.'

  example_answer: 
    - 'the German advance on Paris was weakened by the need to send troops east as Russia had mobilised more quickly than expected. The failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a stalemate in the fighting on the Western Front because after the Battle of the Marne, both sides dug a line of trenches that stretched across France.'

 -Students may progress from a developed explanation of causation by complex
 explanation of the relationship between causes supported by detailed factual
 knowledge and understanding to form a sustained judgement.
 
 -example explanaition: ‘the Alliance system was one of the long term causes of the war
 in the wider context of European rivalry over empires. It did not in itself make
 war inevitable, but it created a framework for conflict. This was triggered in the
 short-term by the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia in 1914.’

 reasoning supported by factual knowledge and understanding.
 --Example answers:
 “explaining the motives and rivalries that led to the Triple Alliance

 -Answers arguing a preference for one judgement but with only basic
 explanation of another view will be marked at this level.
 -Students may progress from a basic explanation of causation by simple
 reasoning and supporting it with factual knowledge and understanding.
 -example answer: ‘the main reason a war broke out was the rivalry that had been
 developing between Britain and Germany over the size of their empires and
 their armed forces. Both countries felt threatened by the development of the
 other and wanted an opportunity to show their superiority by winning a war.’

 -Students recognise and provide a basic explanation of one or more factors.
 -Students may offer a basic explanation of the stated factor, such as, the
 Alliance system brought all the European powers into a war together. They had
 promised to support each other if a war broke out.
 -Students may offer basic explanations of other factor(s), for example, the
 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand caused Austria to declare war and
 this became a World War.
