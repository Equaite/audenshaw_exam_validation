7.1,edexcel_business_studies,,,State one example of a risk for an investor in Ripple.,bs_state,"Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",1

racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
