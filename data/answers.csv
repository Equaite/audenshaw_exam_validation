Britain have produced this as a critical piece of propaganda shown through tittling it betrayed illustrating how the Bolsheviks have broken some sort of allyship with Russia and used this to feed the Germans with information and triple entente wealth.,,3
,2,5092,aqa_history,,"Source B and Source C are both very useful in helping historian understand tactics used in the war and the development of weaponry. Source B shows a artillery barrage which was the tactic the British used to make advances on the German trenches. An Artillery Barrage would consist of shooting multiple rounds of artillery on a set timetable at different distances to provide British troops in No Man's Land cover from any enemy defenses allowing the troops to cross No Man's Land with greater ease leading to a greater number of attacks onto German trenches. This source shows how tactics evolved throughout the war as they had thought of a more viable way of crossing No Man's Land with less German threat. Source C shows the evolution of tanks. At the start of World War 1 tanks were sent out on their own slowly, not posing much of threat to the enemy, but throughout the war tanks became one of the greatest threats to an enemy due to their improved speed and tactics used around them. The creeping barrage was one of the most successful tactics used at war. This would consist of sending out around a dozen tanks onto No man's land with hundreds of soldiers behind them. The soldiers behind would be safe to another German defenses because of the tanks blocking any bullets, also creating an easier way into enemy trenches because tanks would destroy any barbed wire in its way. Tanks would also have 360 machine guns attached to the top allowing it to send cover fire at German's.",,7
,3,5092,aqa_history,,"The Schlieffen plan led to problems throughout Europe in 1914. The plan was for Germans to reach Paris in 6-10 weeks before Russia could mobilize its army. However, the Kaiser decided to pass through Belgium before going to Paris as he believed the French wouldn't expect this. Britain had made an agreement with Belgium to defend them if any country steps into their land, which led to Britain declaring war on the Germans, ruining their plans of reaching Paris in 6-10 weeks. This led to the German offensive on Verdun, an important French city historically. The Germans didn't want to reach Verdun they just wanted to bleed the French dry out of its artillery. The French responded by saying, 'we don't give Verdun up no matter what' France was near breaking point at the time of Britains defensive efforts at Marne. Britain launched an attack on the Germans at river Marne to relieve pressure of French soldiers in Verdun. This worked and France had saved Verdun. despite French and British soldiers having more deaths they saw this as a victory as they had more men to lose than the Germans who lost a lot of soldiers.",,5
,4.1,5092,aqa_history,,"I slightly agree with this statement the alliance system lead to starting of the First World War. Firstly many of the powerful nations believed an alliance led to even greater power for both countries. Many leaders were power hungry and wanted to be the most powerful army which led to countries trying to test and break other alliances. The Germans tested the entente cordiale between France and Britain at the Morocco crisis. France wanted to colonise Morocco, Britain agreed and allowed France to do this. However Germany decided to see how strong the alliance was and defended Morocco from being colonised which created the tension between the entente cordiale and Germany. Tension between Russia and Austria rose during the Balkan crisis. Austria had annexed Bosnia which upset Serbia who asked their Slavic brothers Russia to defend them if war happened between Serbia and Austria. Austria had asked Germany for support after hearing this news leading Germany sending Austria a 'Blank Cheque' meaning they will defend Austria no matter what strengthening their alliance.

In conclusion, Alliance had a huge part to play in the beginning of World War 1 but so did power wanted by leaders who wanted to grow their empires.",,6

,1,5080,aqa_history,,This source was a British cartoon that was made during 1917 or the first world war. In the first world war Britain was allies with Russia which had to surrender due to Russia’s communists or Bolsheviks was starting a revolution against the Tsar. The source shows a woman getting robbed by some creepy man with germany's Kaiser in the background enjoying what is happening. The cartoon shows that the British feel that the Bolsheviks were puppets for the Kaiser and were told to rob Russia of all its resources. The cartoon is even called Betrayed which links with the fact that the Bolsheviks betrayed Russia because the Kaiser told them to.,,4
,2,5080,aqa_history,,"Source B shows how British infantry advanced under the tactic called creeping barrage. In the source it shows British infantry advancing across no man's land while allied artillery shells were shot and exploded not too far in front of them while planes most likely allie planes were flying above communicating with the infantry and artillery to make sure they can surprise the Germans without mass casualties. This source can tell a historian how the creeping barrage was used and how it worked. The source can tell a historian that artillery was shot at a certain angle, so it would land and explode not to go away from the infantry, so they have some sort of cover during a while they walked across no man's land. The historian can also interpret that the planes observing this are most likely coordinating the attack from above telling the artillery when and where to fire and telling the infantry when and how far they should move. 

Source C shows a piece of a book written by a soldier that fought against the Germans during World War One. The source can tell a historian about how useful  the development of tanks during world war one. The source describes how a allied soldier was about to be attacked by german soldiers while stuck in a tank. This could tell a historian that tanks originally were always getting stuck and weren't that helpful at first but then the source describes how the allies were making fast and most likely more powerful tanks as the war went on. The source describes whippets as faster and newer than the one that the writer was using yet again giving back to how the allies we contantly upgrading these tanks. The source then describes how the wippets while giving their machine guns drove straight into the german soldiers and this caused them to scatter. This can tell a historian that first this was a time where tanks only had machine guns and not an artillery cannon welded onto of them and two the fact that these tanks could eliminate a german trench with ease. Source C really highlights how important tanks were to during the first world war.

While source b shows the importance of tanks during the first world war with three example being the creaping barrage and Source C shows the the importance of technology and how important tanks were. In conclusion both Source B and C would show a historian how useful technology and tanks involved as the war continued and how the advancement and development of both was important to the allies winning the war.",,7
,3,5080,aqa_history,,The Schlieffen Plan was a plan made by a top German general before the start of WW1. The Schlieffen Plan was a tactic that would make it so that Germany wouldn't have to fight a war on two fronts in the west against France and the in the east against Russia. The plan was the idea that the Germans would knock France out of the war in 6 weeks by capturing Paris. The Germans then thought that it would take 6 weeks for Russia to mobilize its army to the eastern front. Within those 6 weeks the German army would knock France out of the war then transport its entire army to the eastern front. This of course did not happen. The Schlieffen Plan was doomed to fail. It counted on luck and luck only. ,,4
,4.1,5080,aqa_history,,"The alliance system describes how both the triple entente and the central powers were formed. The triple entente consisted of Britian, France and Russia while the central powers consisted of Germany, Austria - Hungary and Italy. All countries in both alliances promised one thing, to defend each other against an attacking country. 

I do agree that the alliance system was a cause but not the main one. I do believe it is a cause because after the alliances were made tension in Europe increased due to all the big powers in Europe being in an alliance that meant if one country from one alliance attacked then a country from the other alliance it meant meant a full war in europe. The alliance also caused problems in other continents due to Germany wanting an empire of its own but couldn't because Britain and France had colonies there meaning Germany taking land near British and French colonies could cause a war between the 2 alliances.

 However the alliance system wasn't the only big reason why WW1 started. Another reason would be the fact that Germany wanted a navy that could rival Great Britain, which the British didn't want to happen due to their policy of a 2 power standard or that they must have the strongest navy. This lead to an arm race between Britain and Germany to see who could make the most and better weapons than the other. This caused tension to rise between both Britain and germany which didn't help with the fact that Germany had colonys near or not to British ones.

In conclusion although the alliance system was a big reason of why WW1 started I do believe that it is the main reason. Especially combined with the fact that Germany wanted more power in the first place and the creation of the Schlieffen plan even without the alliance system WW1 would of happened anyway. All it did was speed it up.

Source C is useful because it tells us about an experience that a tank commander was stuck but seven whippet tanks came and pushed the German soldiers away.

This also helped to stop stalement and create movement from the other side. How this plan would work is for example a cannon shot every 4 minutes going 30 yards forward everytime. The soldiers would then go right behind where the shell is going to explode and the attack opponents that are still alive and also attack the trenches. Source C shows Britians new development in tanks. The British would take 30-40 tanks to battle. Although tanks were extremily expensive they was very useful becouse of the fact they had a turrent which is a gun inside the tank that can easily rotate 360°. Tanks could also fire shells and were hard to destroy. Although Tanks were good at fighting against the opposition enemys they wasnt very fast only be able to go around 34 mites per hour which is a basic walking pace. Tanks become used more by the British and they was continuely being developed becoming quicker and stronger.

The Austria-Hungary emperur Franz Archduke Ferdinand visited Serbia and got assassinated with his wife by a bosnia man this made the Austria - hungary government angry and they thought it was an act of war. So the Serbia government told the Austria - Hungary government that they will investigate the matter. But the Austria - Hungary government had sent an ultimatum to the Serbia government which said that the Austria - hungary police can go to Serbia and investigate. But the Serbia government rejected it because they didn't want their police in Serbia because they can be spies for their government when the Austria - hungary government found out their request hasn't been approved they cut all the information and communications going Serbia and declared war on Serbia.",,3

In the picture it shows that artillery shells would be fired in front of the troops which would be giving the troops cover to jump into shell holes. This tactic worked majority of the times, but had one big problem. The shells were going so close that if they were fired wrong then they would kill their own soldiers.

Source C is useful to a historian because it talks about the development of tanks. At first tanks were slow which made them an easy target for the germans. The british used the tanks in large groups followed by soldiers. The tanks would provide cover for soldiers and they could destroy barbed wire so the troops could get through later on tanks were improved they were faster and better weapons on board for example bigger shells and turrets.

The Germans then declared war on Belgium. This was a bad decision for Germany as now Britain joined to protect the Belgians. They had eventually got through Belgium and arrived at the French border. 
 
They then declared war on France. The British then asks for Americas help which then meant that the Germans had another army to fight. By this time Russia had mobilized and declared war on Germany.

This process was called artillery barrage, additionally Source B would also be useful to a historian due to the fact that the source was made by a British newspaper this hints to the fact that the newspaper is going to want to present the tactic as being flawless. On the other hand Source C is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the first World War because, the Source is talking about tanks and their new versions, this is useful as it is showing how the British went from tanks that were sent out in ones which led to them being easily picked out and broken by tanks being upgraded and being sent out in groups of 7's, 10, 20's etc, due to the tanks being sent out in groups this led to mass destruction and caused the German soldiers to be scared, it also nullified things such as barbed wire as the tanks could just go over them and flatten them causing the soldiers to be able to easily pass through without being cut, the tanks also provided cover, due to their size and speed multiple soldiers could follow from behind, and the tanks were also upgraded from just having a big cannon that took a long time to turn to having machine guns at the top that could turn a whole 360°, this is useful as it shows the evolution in weapons.",,9
,3,5008,aqa_history,,"the Schlieffen plan led to problems in 1914 as this is when the German's thought they could quickly invade France, however they weren't able to, this is due to different factors an example being the Franco-Prussian alliance, the alliance between France and Russia, although the Germans knew of this alliance they didn't think Russia was prepared for war, however due to the Russians having to back out of multiple wars such as when Austria-Hungary wanted to invade Bosnia, they had been rigorously preparing for any sort of conflict, another factor was the fact that France also had an alliance with Britain, the Entente Cordiale, this led to when Russia was going on their way to invade France, the British sending soldiers to assist France. This led to the German's having to send a big part of their soldier's to deal with The British, furthermore, another factor was the fact that the Germans were running out of resources. Although Germany did invade a large portion of France they still hadn't invaded it whole, this eventually led to them having to dig out trenches and for the British, French, and Russians to have to fight to win back the territory lost, the German trenches were also significantly better than the British and French due to the fact they had already won the land.

Another example is the fact that the British only got involved due to the fact that Russia invaded Belgium and England had an alliance with Belgium, which caused England to come out of their isolationaism.

Tanks were first introduced in the battle of the Somme 1916, but were largely inneffective as they were slow (only reaching speeds of 4 mph), many tactics were

not developed for them as the British thought of not much use for them.

However, the Schlieffen plan failed as Russia only took 10 days to mobilize (faster than expected) and Belgium put up a fierce and resistance fight against the Germans (much more resistance than Germany had anticipated). Ultimately, invading through Belgium only helped the stalemate last longer as Britain was forced to join the war effort as invading Belgium initiated an 1843 treaty of London where Britain vowed to protect Belgium.

The first issue this caused was a war on two front west France, east Russia. This meant that Germany was spread thin on supply meaning the soldiers began to starve as they couldn't transport food to 2 fronts. For survival the Germans began to dig trenches so the British and the French did too.

This was the second issue the creation of trenches led to a stalemate. During this thousands of men died but no land was taken due to periods of heavy artillery fire. In addition the trenches condition caused issues as disease spread fast so hundreds died due to a lack of hygiene for example trench foot from the muddy floor and cholera was spread due to flees bitting the infected and spreading it.",,4

Contextually we can infer that sential Communist Lenin was sent from Switzerland to Russia where he was exiled to stir up tensions on Russia so that the Germans could get some relief off the Eastern front. The style of clothing that the Russian Imperialist is wearing represents royalty which ties into the fact that Russia had its monarchy killed during the revolution to show its harsh and neglect that it gave to the Russian people centuries prior.

In 1917, the British forces were able to tactically redirected the way they used artillery by creating a creeping barrage where in a certain order a certain amount of shells could be fired upfront at the troops to clear any enemy ground/territory, which provided as a explosive shield which now able to give them easier access towards the trench for bayonett charging. This was vital to break the stalemate as a historian can gather the fact that the German forces were overwhelmed at the change in fire rate which  was able to will thousand more proving to be more effective. Due to the smoke after the

explosion, the Germans couldn't also see the advancing troops in front of them which caused major distress. Source C brings the idea of tanks into the question which was a revolutionary idea at the time as there was anything like it. In September 1916 the first battalion of tanks were deployed into the Battle of the Somme which allowed for the ease of movement to continue. Trenches had become ineffective for the Germany as they could have just been ran over. Barbed wire which was a massive problem until this point also became ineffective as tanks could have just flattened them causing no distress from when explosives blew them up which only led to them becoming noisy. The tanks had a 360 turret which was later developed which could shoot from anywhere. In the Battle of Cambrai, 1917 they were able to use the tanks for a circular formation in rows as the Battle of the Somme let only 50 tanks remaining from the 400 used.

Number one was that sometime before the war, France had created the Maginot line to protect himself from Germany if they were to ever attack again. This meant Germany had to divert for Belgium. However, in 1839 the Treaty of London was signed with Britain giving full support for Belgium as they gained independence from any country willing to attack them. This meant if Germany diverted for Belgium they would face a double threat with Britain joining the war. The Belgian army too would be employed adding resistance towards the Germans. On the Eastern side, Russia before the war was able to muster up men in the course of 4 weeks which wasn't apart of Germany plan as they assumed Russia would be the attack as a surprise. This led to a war on two fronts. The BEF also came in time to support the invasion before the Germans got to Paris.",,8

The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. 

Source C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C 
describes how the army constantly made new prototypes 
as the tanks so they could be faster and cause 
more casualties. This meant there was less hand to 
hand fighting because of the tanks physiological and 
devastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C

,3,5091,aqa_history,,"The Schlieffen plan already had some problems to it, even before it was put into practise. For example it relied on the slow mobilisation of Russia. As the Germans would find out, the Russian army mobilised in just 10 days and had already consigned plans to attack in the East. This meant the Germans would have to fight a war on two fronts, exactly what was trying to be avoided. Furthermore after the death of Alfred Von Schlieffen in 1913, the next general made the army smaller for the assault on France, and also missed Holland from the plan entirely. This meant the Germans would have a weaker force in battle, additioning to them having to divide there army in half to fight in two fronts.

The German plan also relied on Belgium’s invasion which they thought would be quick and easy. However, the Belgian army put up stiff resistance trying forts and its small army, slowing down the German advancement. This gave France and Russia time to communicate and mobilise. Furthermore the German army underestimated the pact Britain had with Belgium in the 1890's, supporting its neutralaty. Therefore when they invaded Belgium and entered through France, The BEF was sent out to stop the Germany army. to May 1914 France and the BEF fought the Germans at the battle of Mons, contributing to stalemate the failure of the Schielfen plan.",,8

However, the plan had several weaknesses that led to problems in 1914. One key issue was the violation of Belgian neutrality. Germany's invasion of Belgium to execute the Schlieffen Plan brought the UK into the war. As they were committed to protecting Belgian neutrality. This decision significantly expanded the conflict beyond what Germany anticipated. additionally, the Schlieffen Plan relied heavily on precise timing and movement of troops. any delays or miscalculations in the execution of the plan could mess up the plan. This became evident during the Battle of the Marne when German advance had halted, forcing them to retreat. The failure to achieve a quick victory in France undermined the core principle of the Schlieffen Plan, leading to a prolonged and costly war on the Western front furthermore, the plan underestimated the resilience and determination of the allied forces. the french and british armies put up a strong defence slowing down the German advances. The inability to swiftly defeat France g impeded by the Schlieffen plan's failure to deliver a swift victory in France. the violation of Belgium, and the resiliency of the the allied forces all contributed to the problems faced in 1916. these factors ultimately led to a protracted and devastating conflict that diverged significantly from the initial expectations of the german military command.",,4

Later on in 1911 a rebellion happen in Morocco so the king of Morocco asked France for help and so France deployed 20,000 troops in Morocco, Germany got news of this and though France were trying to invade Morocco so the Kaiser decided to deploy battleship all around Morocco as people realised what the Kaiser wanted after this incident other nations started preparing for war.

So my conclusion is that although the alliance system was an important factor to the build up of the war it wasnt the main factor and it was in fact a mix of all these things put together.  ",,3

This is the better option compared to option 2 as she is already trying to promote her business through customers so using social media would be a waste of time. Choosing option 1 will help keep loyalty within female customers. This is because they do not have to pay as much which attract them even more. Having more loyalty will increase sales as more customers are attracted. Another positive of option 1 is that it may attract even more new customers. This is because discounting female customers betters her unique selling point making her business stand out to competitors. This will attract more customers which will increase sales and revenue to invest. Another positive is that she may gain promotion from option 1 anyway.

,7.5,5063,edexcel_business_studies,,"The importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix is significant as it helps them to compete. This is because they question customers to find out how much energy they use. This helps Ripple create a price for the customer to invest and helps to reduce how much the customers pay. This helps to match and offer lower prices to competitors. This may attract customers as price is a customer need. Another reason why price is important is that it helps to determine how much energy a customer gets. This is important as it will increase the reliability and quality of their service and product as it lets them know that they are getting value for their money. This may keep customers more loyal and increase Ripple's sales. However, price may not be as important in Ripple's marketing mix. Place is also an important part. This is because Ripple needs to locate its turbines to the areas with the most wind. This will help increase the productivity of the turbines which will help improve the efficiency. This will give the customers a lower price which may attract them even more. Where they are located is also important as it may require them to pay more to transport energy to customers, raising their prices. This may prevent customers from using Ripple as they may not get the energy as fast and may have to pay a higher price for the energy compared to competitors.Another important factor of Ripples marketing mix is its promotion. This is because they have to promote how environmentally friendly this energy is compared to others. This will help attract more customers and target those who wish to be more environmentally friendly. This will help to increase their sales as more people are aware of how environmentally friendly they are.
