Bolsheviks as in the source it
shows them taking German gold
away from Russia. Also the
source looks as though the
German Kaiser has sent the
Bolsheviks to steal from Russia and
betray them, the Kaiser stood in
the doorway rubbing his hands
together shows that he will get
something out of it.",,1

I think Sources
B and C are very useful to 
a historian studying military 
technology and tactics in the 
First World War as in 
Source B it shows us British 
soldiers advancing under an artillery 
barrage. This was called the creeping 
barrage. The creeping barrage was used
to destroy anything infront of 
the soldiers then they would 
all follow in clearing up the 
rest including the tanks going in.
Source C is also useful as it 
shows how big of a difference tanks 
made in war as they could 
quickly destroy through German 
soldiers and smash through anything 
in its path.",,4
,3,5000,aqa_history,,"The Schlieffen plan led to problems in 1914 as
 Germany wanted to have an empire like Britain or France. 
 This led to a large increase in power and size of the army in order to invade and colonise. 
 This led to problems as Britain, France and other global powers were starting to get worried about their empires.",,0
,4.1,5000,aqa_history,," I agree with this statement as I believe the pressure France, 
Britain and Russia were putting on Germany built made tensions high in Europe, this made Germany very wary of what it did. 
However, another main cause of the First World War was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Austria-Hungary,
 this also built tension as many people thought it was the German goverment behind it.

The Alliance System also meant that each country would have to help if one was attacked by Germany, 
this is the idea of the Triple Entente. Also, as Britain was allies with Belgium, 
they Britain and France both promised to attack if Germany tried to invade Belgium and try to keep them out. 
In conclusion, I do think the Alliance system was the main cause as in the end Germany was trying to invade many of Britains' France's or Russia's allies or colonies, so they had to declare war on Germany and fight back.",,8

,1,5091,aqa_history,,"Source A shows a bearded man tussling with a young woman and stealing her wealth. This has been used to show the actions of the Bolsheviks in December 1917 and how, encouraged by the kaiser in the doorway, they stole wealth from there own country, and gave it to the Germans. We know in late 1917 Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and lost lots of its land and resources in return for a cease fire in the Eastern Front. The British created the cartoon to show how the Triple Entente had been betrayed by russia and to criticise there actions; Russian withdrawl from the War meant war was only now fought from one front.",,4
,2,5091,aqa_history,,"Source B shows a depiction of the Western Front with two types of new technology and tactics being shown. The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. 

Source C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C 
describes how the army constantly made new prototypes 
as the tanks so they could be faster and cause 
more casualties. This meant there was less hand to 
hand fighting because of the tanks physiological and 
devastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C 
is useful to a historian because it has personal 
story from someone actually experiencing the power 
of tanks, showing how the threat they brought. ",,9
,3,5091,aqa_history,,"The Schlieffen plan already had some problems to it, even before it was put into practise. For example it relied on the slow mobilisation of Russia. As the Germans would find out, the Russian army mobilised in just 10 days and had already consigned plans to attack in the East. This meant the Germans would have to fight a war on two fronts, exactly what was trying to be avoided. Furthermore after the death of Alfred Von Schlieffen in 1913, the next general made the army smaller for the assault on France, and also missed Holland from the plan entirely. This meant the Germans would have a weaker force in battle, additioning to them having to divide there army in half to fight in two fronts.

The German plan also relied on Belgiumâ€™s invasion which they thought would be quick and easy. However, the Belgian army put up stiff resistance trying forts and its small army, slowing down the German advancement. This gave France and Russia time to communicate and mobilise. Furthermore the German army underestimated the pact Britain had with Belgium in the 1890's, supporting its neutralaty. Therefore when they invaded Belgium and entered through France, The BEF was sent out to stop the Germany army. to May 1914 France and the BEF fought the Germans at the battle of Mons, contributing to stalemate the failure of the Schielfen plan.",,8
,4.1,5091,aqa_history,,"In Some ways the Alliance System was a major factor to outbreak of War because it gave Germany an excuse to declare it. When Britian Russia and France signed the Triple Entente in retaliation of the Triple Alliance Germany used it to complain that they were being circled in. The Triple entente was used to make Germany back down but could of been a factor for war. Once the two sides were created it was clear War was imminent but Germany and its allies were keen for war then in contrast France and Russia and Britain made a pact us Allience to detterent Germany.

However the assasination os archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbia's black hand Gang also was a jumpstart to war. After the Assassin Austria-Hungery blamed Serbia and had intellignce the Black hand Gang was helped by the Serb government this gave the kaiser a motivation for war due to it alliance with Austria - Hungery. The Austrian government gave Serbia a 10 point deal which they agreed to all but one (letting Austrian soldiers into Serbia). Within a

days War was declared. Russia was dragged in due to its alliance with Serbia and the Germans started there Schlieffen plan in the West turning the Balkans war to a world war.

Finally the Moroccan Crisis was another reason why Germany were happy for a war to start.
France wanted to take over Morocco but Germany also wanted to expand its empire so the kaiser sent a warship into the ports of Morocco to show Germany wanted to be part of World affairs too. The French were outraged and a meeting in Algeciras (Spain) with the USA, Britain, Germany and France calmed the situation down preventing early war. The kaiser did this to see how Sent France could be pushed but Germany was humiliated when Britain Supported France due to there alliance. In 1911 the French were called into Morocco to settle a rebellion but Germany accused France of invading the country. Ultimately it was declared France would take full control of Morocco which humiliated the Kaiser for a Second time. He wanted to prove Germany's strength and it was clear he would not back down a third time, therefor 
when Franz Ferdinand was killed, Germany declared War.",,10

,1,5001,aqa_history,,"Contextually, source A displays how during the Russian resolution of 1917 which led to the bolsheviks becoming in power, the bolsheviks 'backstabbed the allies' and russia while Kaiser Wilhelm II is very eagerly watching in the background. This represents the allies frustration against russia and especially the bolsheviks as they left the war and had signed a peace treaty with Germany giving up significant portions of valueable land.

,2,5001,aqa_history,,"In source B, we can see an image displaying the tradectory of artillery bombardments. The allies use the cover created by the smoke and explosions to advance through no-mans land with the element of surprise. This allowed it so that the enemy would have a difficult time discerning where the enemy were attacking from. This form of tactical manouvering is known as a 'creeping barrage'. The allies would time artillery bombardment at certain angles and simultaneously the soldiers would 'creep in'.

Tanks were first introduced in the battle of the Somme 1916, but were largely inneffective as they were slow (only reaching speeds of 4 mph), many tactics were

not developed for them as the British thought of not much use for them. But by 1917 and 1918, tanks were being deployed in large rows of 200-300 tanks which would cross over no-mans land and destroy the barbed wire defences. In source C, we see the mention of machine guns on the tanks as they were added as a way to bring more firepower. These machine guns were mounted on and could turn 360 degrees to inflict damage upon the enemies.",,7
,3,5001,aqa_history,,"The Schlieffen plan was heavily reliant on Russia taking a long time to mobilize and a very quick and decisive win against France (in 40 days). The plan was to have a large bulk of the German army invade France by cutting into Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to surprise the French, who would be anticipating an attack directly into France on the boarder between them. However, the Schlieffen plan failed as Russia only took 10 days to mobilize (faster than expected) and Belgium put up a fierce and resistance fight against the Germans (much more resistance than Germany had anticipated). Ultimately, invading through Belgium only helped the stalemate last longer as Britain was forced to join the war effort as invading Belgium initiated an 1843 treaty of London where Britain vowed to protect Belgium. This prolonged the war significantly, turning 40 days into 4 years.

,4.1,5001,aqa_history,,"I agree with the statement as the alliances meant that Europe was divided in two different camps. The alliances were the main trigger for many of the events, wars and crises that led up to world war one. The black hand (a terrorist group) assasinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the heir to the austrian-hungarian throne) leaving only serbia to blame for the assasination. Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany. Then Germany invaded Belgium bringing Britain into the war as it triggered the 1843 treaty of London which Britain vowed to protect Belgium from invading forces. Because of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's death,Europe was involved in an all-out war.

In 1871, shortly after Germany's unification, Germany and Austria-Hungary made an alliance together as they both shared similar cuteral identities,had shared the same common language of German and were politically close to each other. Later, the Italians joined the dual alliance to form the triple alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. In 1892, France and Russia formed an alliance together. This was a threat towards Germany as it meant they could be attacked from either the East or the West. Later in 1904, Britain formed an alliance with France, known as the Entente Cordiale (Friendly alliance). Then in 1906, Britain, France and Russia all came together to form the triple Entente. The alliance system made political disputes more intense as one disagreement could lead to a major war. This is clearly seen in the Moroccan crisises and the Balkan wars. The involvement of this many countries made it impossible to avoid an all  out war from breaking out in Europe, thus causing the start of World War One.",,6

anything about the bolskveiks trying to steal the gold. They

,2,5002,aqa_history,,"In source B it shows the British Soilders advancing under an artillery barrage. The british Soilder were running in waves all in different waves. this is because they cannot be in any artillery barage. you can see that all the soilders are running and still alive and not getting under an artillery barage. Each wave protects you from a plane and from bombs dropping on you.

In Source C it Shows that the german Soilder were preparing an attack on the british tank, but then 7 of the newest and fastest tanks named whippets came and drove straight into the german Soilders and scattered them in all directions, which this had destroyed the German threat. This helps the students studying military technology understand about how fast and powerful the Whippet was. In source B shows how useful and how good the strategy was used by the british soldiers were they could run across the battlefield without dying this helps the student studying Military technology.
