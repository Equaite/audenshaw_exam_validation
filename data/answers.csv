This has been used to show the actions of the Bolsheviks in December 1917 and how, encouraged by the kaiser in the doorway, they stole wealth from there own country, and gave it to the Germans. We know in late 1917 Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and lost lots of its land and resources in return for a cease fire in the Eastern Front. The British created the cartoon to show how the Triple Entente had been betrayed by russia and to criticise there actions; Russian withdrawl from the War meant war was only now fought from one front.",,4
,2,5091,aqa_history,,"Source B shows a depiction of the Western Front with two types of new technology and tactics being shown. The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. 

Source C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C 
describes how the army constantly made new prototypes 
as the tanks so they could be faster and cause 
more casualties. This meant there was less hand to 
hand fighting because of the tanks physiological and 
devastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C 
is useful to a historian because it has personal 
story from someone actually experiencing the power 
of tanks, showing how the threat they brought. ",,9
,3,5091,aqa_history,,"The Schlieffen plan already had some problems to it, even before it was put into practise. For example it relied on the slow mobilisation of Russia. As the Germans would find out, the Russian army mobilised in just 10 days and had already consigned plans to attack in the East. This meant the Germans would have to fight a war on two fronts, exactly what was trying to be avoided. Furthermore after the death of Alfred Von Schlieffen in 1913, the next general made the army smaller for the assault on France, and also missed Holland from the plan entirely. This meant the Germans would have a weaker force in battle, additioning to them having to divide there army in half to fight in two fronts.

The German plan also relied on Belgiumâ€™s invasion which they thought would be quick and easy. However, the Belgian army put up stiff resistance trying forts and its small army, slowing down the German advancement. This gave France and Russia time to communicate and mobilise. Furthermore the German army underestimated the pact Britain had with Belgium in the 1890's, supporting its neutralaty. Therefore when they invaded Belgium and entered through France, The BEF was sent out to stop the Germany army. to May 1914 France and the BEF fought the Germans at the battle of Mons, contributing to stalemate the failure of the Schielfen plan.",,8

However the assasination os archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbia's black hand Gang also was a jumpstart to war. After the Assassin Austria-Hungery blamed Serbia and had intellignce the Black hand Gang was helped by the Serb government this gave the kaiser a motivation for war due to it alliance with Austria - Hungery.

days War was declared. Russia was dragged in due to its alliance with Serbia and the Germans started there Schlieffen plan in the West turning the Balkans war to a world war.

Finally the Moroccan Crisis was another reason why Germany were happy for a war to start.
France wanted to take over Morocco but Germany also wanted to expand its empire so the kaiser sent a warship into the ports of Morocco to show Germany wanted to be part of World affairs too. The French were outraged and a meeting in Algeciras (Spain) with the USA, Britain, Germany and France calmed the situation down preventing early war.

,2,5001,aqa_history,,"In source B, we can see an image displaying the tradectory of artillery bombardments. The allies use the cover created by the smoke and explosions to advance through no-mans land with the element of surprise. This allowed it so that the enemy would have a difficult time discerning where the enemy were attacking from. This form of tactical manouvering is known as a 'creeping barrage'. The allies would time artillery bombardment at certain angles and simultaneously the soldiers would 'creep in'.

Tanks were first introduced in the battle of the Somme 1916, but were largely inneffective as they were slow (only reaching speeds of 4 mph), many tactics were

not developed for them as the British thought of not much use for them. But by 1917 and 1918, tanks were being deployed in large rows of 200-300 tanks which would cross over no-mans land and destroy the barbed wire defences. In source C, we see the mention of machine guns on the tanks as they were added as a way to bring more firepower. These machine guns were mounted on and could turn 360 degrees to inflict damage upon the enemies.",,7
,3,5001,aqa_history,,"The Schlieffen plan was heavily reliant on Russia taking a long time to mobilize and a very quick and decisive win against France (in 40 days). The plan was to have a large bulk of the German army invade France by cutting into Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to surprise the French, who would be anticipating an attack directly into France on the boarder between them. However, the Schlieffen plan failed as Russia only took 10 days to mobilize (faster than expected) and Belgium put up a fierce and resistance fight against the Germans (much more resistance than Germany had anticipated). Ultimately, invading through Belgium only helped the stalemate last longer as Britain was forced to join the war effort as invading Belgium initiated an 1843 treaty of London where Britain vowed to protect Belgium. This prolonged the war significantly, turning 40 days into 4 years.

Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force).

The picture was published in a British newspaper and and could be an awareness to show the changes of technology to the citizens of great Britain. In this case, the changes in technology could be the artillery due to its raw increase accuracy and fire rate. Another charge in technology was fighter planes. The way that the fighter get could damage people and find them was due to a savee secret compartment where they could throw bombs out of it creating the havoc among the soilders on the groud. Some planes had a camera attached to the plane so it could take a birds eye view picture to find and locate the exact co-ordinates to attack them.

This was the second issue the creation of trenches led to a stalemate. During this thousands of men died but no land was taken due to periods of heavy artillery fire.

Contextually we know that during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the battle of Passchendaele. In 1917, the British forces were able to tactically redirected the way they used artillery by creating a creeping barrage where in a certain order a certain amount of shells could be fired upfront at the troops to clear any enemy ground/territory, which provided as a explosive shield which now able to give them easier access towards the trench for bayonett charging. This was vital to break the stalemate as a historian can gather the fact that the German forces were overwhelmed at the change in fire rate which  was able to will thousand more proving to be more effective. Due to the smoke after the

explosion, the Germans couldn't also see the advancing troops in front of them which caused major distress. Source C brings the idea of tanks into the question which was a revolutionary idea at the time as there was anything like it. In September 1916 the first battalion of tanks were deployed into the Battle of the Somme which allowed for the ease of movement to continue. Trenches had become ineffective for the Germany as they could have just been ran over. Barbed wire which was a massive problem until this point also became ineffective as tanks could have just flattened them causing no distress from when explosives blew them up which only led to them becoming noisy. The tanks had a 360 turret which was later developed which could shoot from anywhere. In the Battle of Cambrai, 1917 they were able to use the tanks for a circular formation in rows as the Battle of the Somme let only 50 tanks remaining from the 400 used.

,3,5058,aqa_history,,"In the 19th Century just after the Franco-Prussian war which was a victory for Prussia, Alfred von Schlieffen created a plan which was fairly simple in a way to take out two of Europeâ€™s biggest powers: France and Russia doing this by gathering a number of 750,000 troops, going through Alsace-Lorraine taking out France before diverting for Russia taking both out in the general scheme, however there was major flaws to this. Number one was that sometime before the war, France had created the Maginot line to protect himself from Germany if they were to ever attack again. This meant Germany had to divert for Belgium. However, in 1839 the Treaty of London was signed with Britain giving full support for Belgium as they gained independence from any country willing to attack them. This meant if Germany diverted for Belgium they would face a double threat with Britain joining the war. The Belgian army too would be employed adding resistance towards the Germans.
